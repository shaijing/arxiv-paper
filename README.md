| **[The Empty Chair: Using LLMs to Raise Missing Perspectives in Policy Deliberations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13812v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deliberation is essential to well-functioning democracies, yet physical, economic, and social barriers often exclude certain groups, reducing representativeness and contributing to issues like group polarization. In this work, we explore the use of large language model (LLM) personas to introduce missing perspectives in policy deliberations. We develop and evaluate a tool that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens' assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the tool was useful to spark new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not previously considered. However, they also raised skepticism about the ability of LLMs to accurately characterize the perspectives of different groups, especially ones that are already underrepresented. Overall, this case study highlights that while AI personas can usefully surface new perspectives and prompt discussion in deliberative settings, their successful deployment depends on clarifying their limitations and emphasizing that they complement rather than replace genuine participation.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: PersonaLLM: Workshop on LLM Persona Modeling</p></details> |
| **[Reflections on the Reproducibility of Commercial LLM Performance in Empirical Software Engineering Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25506v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone 78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs. Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86 articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech-Audio Compositional Attacks on Multimodal LLMs and Their Mitigation with SALMONN-Guard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10222v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

| **[Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: Two TMLR revision rounds addressing reviewer feedback.

| **[SEAL: Subspace-Anchored Watermarks for LLM Ownership](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11356v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, demonstrating human-level performance in text generation, reasoning, and question answering. However, training such models requires substantial computational resources, large curated datasets, and sophisticated alignment procedures. As a result, they constitute highly valuable intellectual property (IP) assets that warrant robust protection mechanisms. Existing IP protection approaches suffer from critical limitations. Model fingerprinting techniques can identify model architectures but fail to establish ownership of specific model instances. In contrast, traditional backdoor-based watermarking methods embed behavioral anomalies that can be easily removed through common post-processing operations such as fine-tuning or knowledge distillation. We propose SEAL, a subspace-anchored watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit signatures directly into the model's latent representational space, supporting both white-box and black-box verification scenarios. Our approach leverages model editing techniques to align the hidden representations of selected anchor samples with predefined orthogonal bit vectors. This alignment embeds the watermark while preserving the model's original factual predictions, rendering the watermark functionally harmless and stealthy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and six prominent LLMs, comparing SEAL with 11 existing fingerprinting and watermarking methods to demonstrate its superior effectiveness, fidelity, efficiency, and robustness. Furthermore, we evaluate SEAL under potential knowledgeable attacks and show that it maintains strong verification performance even when adversaries possess knowledge of the watermarking mechanism and the embedded signatures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable LLM Guardrails via Sparse Representation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16851v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in generation tasks but are prone to producing harmful, misleading, or biased content, posing significant ethical and safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, representation engineering, which steer model behavior toward desired attributes by injecting carefully designed steering vectors into LLM's representations at inference time, has emerged as a promising alternative to fine-tuning approaches. However, due to the semantically entangled nature of LLM's representation, existing representation engineering methods still suffer from several limitations: limited fine-grained controllability, content quality degradation, and conflict in multi-attribute control. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse Representation Steering (SRS), a novel framework that achieves fine-grained and interpretable control over LLM behavior by first disentangling internal activations into a sparse, semantically meaningful representation space, and then selectively steering relevant dimensions. Specifically, SRS leverages a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to transform dense, entangled activation patterns into a sparse monosemantic feature space. To identify relevant features, SRS contrasts sparse activations from positive and negative prompt pairs and measures their bidirectional KL divergence to locate dimensions most associated with the target attribute. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Gemma-2 series model across three alignment dimensions, i.e., safety, fairness, and truthfulness, to evaluate the effectiveness of SRS. Results show that SRS consistently outperforms existing steering methods, which achieves significantly improved controllability across both single and multiple attribute settings, while preserving high linguistic quality and general ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[KGQuest: Template-Driven QA Generation from Knowledge Graphs with LLM-Based Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11258v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIonopedia: an LLM agent orchestrating multimodal learning for ionic liquid discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11257v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Align$^3$GR: Unified Multi-Level Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11255v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[UAVBench: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Autonomous and Agentic AI UAV Systems via LLM-Generated Flight Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11252v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Prompt Engineering vs. Fine-Tuning for LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection in Solana and Algorand Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11250v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts have emerged as key components within decentralized environments, enabling the automation of transactions through self-executing programs. While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-MAN: Enabling End-to-End Low-Bit LLM Inference on NPUs via Unified Table Lookup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11248v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on customer devices. To support them, current devices are adopting SoCs (System on Chip) with NPUs (Neural Processing Unit) installed. Although high performance is expected, LLM inference on NPUs is slower than its CPU counterpart. The reason is that NPUs have poor performance on computations other than GEMM, like dequantization. Current works either disaggregate prefill on the NPUs and decoding on the CPUs, or put both on the NPUs but with an accuracy loss. To solve this issue, based on the insight that low-bit can enable target computation encoded within an acceptably sized table, we propose table lookup to subsume hardware operations otherwise unsupported. To realize this, we overcome the conflicting hardware behavior of prefill and decoding to design a unified table layout and tiling through (1) fused two-level table-based dequantization and (2) concurrency-hierarchy-guided tiling. Based on that, we implement the prefill phase by three-stage pipeline and map the table-lookup-based decoding to NPU's vector units. Results show 1.4x and 3.1x speedup for prefill and decoding respectively, and 84% energy savings compared to the baseline NPU methods.

| **[ICL-Router: In-Context Learned Model Representations for LLM Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09719v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Utilizing LLMs for Industrial Process Automation: A Case Study on Modifying RAPID Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11125v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) track Software Engineering in Practice (SEIP) 2026</p></details> |

Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in AAAI'26</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, manual patching is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques remain limited in effectiveness. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened a new paradigm for AVR, demonstrating remarkable progress. To examine the capability of LLMs in AVR, several vulnerability benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, they still suffer from key limitations of outdated vulnerabilities, limited language coverage, unreliable patch validation, and insufficient reproducibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PATCHEVAL, a multilingual benchmark for Go, JavaScript, and Python, languages for which existing benchmarks remain unexplored. PATCHEVAL curates a dataset of 1,000 vulnerabilities drawn from CVEs reported between 2015 and 2025, covering 65 distinct CWEs. A subset of 230 CVEs is further equipped with runtime sandbox environments, enabling patch verification through both security tests and functionality tests. To provide a systematic comparison of LLM-based vulnerability repair, we evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and agents, presenting an in-depth analysis that empirically yields key insights to guide future research in AVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICE: SLO-Driven Scheduling for LLM Inference on Edge Computing Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18544v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs. This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To address these challenges, an end-to-end framework, namely DialogGraph-LLM, is proposed in the current work. DialogGraph-LLM combines a novel Multi-Relational Dialogue Attention Network (MR-DAN) architecture with multimodal foundation models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) for direct acoustic-to-intent inference. An adaptive semi-supervised learning strategy is designed using LLM with a confidence-aware pseudo-label generation mechanism based on dual-threshold filtering using both global and class confidences, and an entropy-based sample selection process that prioritizes high-information unlabeled instances. Extensive evaluations on the proprietary MarketCalls corpus and the publicly available MIntRec 2.0 benchmark demonstrate DialogGraph-LLM's superiority over strong audio and text-driven baselines. The framework demonstrates strong performance and efficiency in intent recognition in real world scenario audio dialogues, proving its practical value for audio-rich domains with limited supervision.

The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

However, deploying such models in the real world often requires adapting them to the highly specialized database schemas used in specific applications. We find that existing text-to-SQL models experience significant performance drops when applied to new schemas, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This data scarcity also limits the ability to effectively evaluate model performance in new domains. Continuously obtaining high-quality text-to-SQL data for evolving schemas is prohibitively expensive in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose SQLsynth, a human-in-the-loop text-to-SQL data annotation system. SQLsynth streamlines the creation of high-quality text-to-SQL datasets through human-LLM collaboration in a structured workflow. A within-subjects user study comparing SQLsynth with manual annotation and ChatGPT shows that SQLsynth significantly accelerates text-to-SQL data annotation, reduces cognitive load, and produces datasets that are more accurate, natural, and diverse.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10067v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10890v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.</p></details> |  |

However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Yet it remains unclear whether such biases are systematic, which data-level factors drive them, and what internal mechanisms underlie their emergence. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of format bias in LLMs through a three-stage empirical analysis. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage examines how key data-level factors influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its effectiveness. Our results show that format bias is consistent across model families, driven by information richness, structure quality, and representation type, and is closely associated with attention imbalance within the LLMs. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: enhancing data pre-processing through format repair and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026, camera ready version</p></details> |

Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events.

Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AIWare 2025</p></details> |

To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Parameter Space Symmetries for Reasoning Skill Transfer in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10850v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Verified Code Reasoning by LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26546v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature). As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps. We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.</p></details> | 43 pages |

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 35 figures, under review.

Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing major challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs for cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it limits the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. Compounding these challenges is the fact that real-world scientific questions are typically complex and open-ended, requiring reasoning beyond pattern matching or static knowledge retrieval.To address these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses - all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.

This paper investigates the limits of LLM inference, focusing on hardware-imposed bottlenecks in auto-regressive decoding. We develop LIMINAL, an analytical performance model that abstracts application requirements and hardware capabilities to systematically explore performance and efficiency across a wide range of current, near-future, and hypothetical hardware. We find LIMINAL is accurate when comparing to LLMs executing on existing hardware, achieving a mean absolute error of $7.6\%$. Our analysis spans from current HBM3 memory technology used in AI accelerators like GPUs and TPUs to systems based on advanced HBM4 and advanced 3D-stacked DRAM technology. We identify five non-negotiable challenges for LLM inference hardware, establishing compute, memory capacity, bandwidth and collective communication as primary barriers to performance. These findings suggest that achieving significant performance gains beyond 10,000 tokens-per-second will require not just hardware evolution but also fundamental algorithmic advances.</p></details> |  |

However, prior evaluations of LLM-based opinion simulation have relied heavily on costly, domain-specific survey data, and mixed empirical results leave their reliability in question. To enable cost-effective, early-stage evaluation, we introduce a quality control assessment designed to test the viability of LLM-simulated opinions on Likert-scale tasks without requiring large-scale human data for validation. This assessment comprises two key tests: \emph{logical consistency} and \emph{alignment with stakeholder expectations}, offering a low-cost, domain-adaptable validation tool. We apply our quality control assessment to an opinion simulation task relevant to AI-assisted content moderation and fact-checking workflows -- a socially impactful use case -- and evaluate seven LLMs using a baseline prompt engineering method (backstory prompting), as well as fine-tuning and in-context learning variants. None of the models or methods pass the full assessment, revealing several failure modes.

Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects.

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is intended for submission to the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems for possible publication</p></details> |

Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PITA: Preference-Guided Inference-Time Alignment for LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20067v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10459v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[REACT-LLM: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Integration with Causal Features in Clinical Prognostic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07127v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.</p></details> |  |

However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of Eval4NLP workshop at AACL 2025.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.</p></details> | Journal resubmission |
| **[Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.</p></details> | 46 pages |
| **[EDGC: Entropy-driven Dynamic Gradient Compression for Efficient LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10333v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Training CNNs to Classify and Localize Memorization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02573v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy and the attention weights involved in decoding. We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories: memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights involved in each form of memorization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at AAAI-26</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |
| **[Rethinking Visual Information Processing in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10301v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Code Review Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11034v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained prominence in the field of software development, significantly boosting productivity and simplifying teamwork. Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time, optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling, including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60% (9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%), bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Workshop on Graphs and more Complex Structures For Learning and Reasoning (GCLR)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages; To be published in AAAI-26</p></details> |

However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. 25 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Safeguarding Open-Source LLMs Against Unauthorized Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10712v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Probabilistic Fusion for Label-Efficient Document Layout Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08903v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Format Matters: The Robustness of Multimodal LLMs in Reviewing Evidence from Tables and Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10075v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Continuous Benchmark Generation for Evaluating Enterprise-scale LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10049v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of AI agents across domains has made systematic evaluation crucial for ensuring their usefulness and successful production deployment. Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite (https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ML4H ...</summary><p>ML4H 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |

However, optimal pricing in LLM routing platforms requires precise modeling for dynamic service markets, and solving this problem in real time at scale is computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose \PriLLM, a novel practical and scalable solution for real-time dynamic pricing in competitive LLM routing. \PriLLM models the service market as a Stackelberg game, where providers set prices and users select services based on multiple criteria. To capture real-world market dynamics, we incorporate both objective factors (\eg~cost, QoS) and subjective user preferences into the model. For scalability, we employ a deep aggregation network to learn provider abstraction that preserve user-side equilibrium behavior across pricing strategies. Moreover, \PriLLM offers interpretability by explaining its pricing decisions. Empirical evaluation on real-world data shows that \PriLLM achieves over 95\% of the optimal profit while only requiring less than 5\% of the optimal solution's computation time.</p></details> | Extended version |

Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones. Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners. From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, to be published in SIGCSE '26</p></details> |

Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

While pruning reduces these demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV) workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$ compared to the baseline dense model.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[Unlearning Imperative: Securing Trustworthy and Responsible LLMs through Engineered Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09855v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.</p></details> |  |

It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

This paper introduces the GAP (Graph of Attacks with Pruning) framework, an advanced approach for generating stealthy jailbreak prompts to evaluate and enhance LLM safeguards. GAP addresses limitations in existing tree-based LLM jailbreak methods by implementing an interconnected graph structure that enables knowledge sharing across attack paths.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM Inference Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17741v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICRO '25</p></details> |

Managing such mixed workloads is challenging due to the complexity of the inference serving stack, which encompasses multiple models, GPU hardware, and global data centers. Existing solutions often silo such fast and slow tasks onto separate GPU resource pools with different SLAs, but this leads to significant under-utilization of expensive accelerators due to load mismatch. In this article, we characterize the LLM serving workloads at Microsoft Office 365, one of the largest users of LLMs within Microsoft Azure cloud with over 10 million requests per day, and highlight key observations across workloads in different data center regions and across time. This is one of the first such public studies of Internet-scale LLM workloads. We use these insights to propose SageServe, a comprehensive LLM serving framework that dynamically adapts to workload demands using multi-timescale control knobs. It combines short-term request routing to data centers with long-term scaling of GPU VMs and model placement with higher lead times, and co-optimizes the routing and resource allocation problem using a traffic forecast model and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. We evaluate SageServe through real runs and realistic simulations on 10 million production requests across three regions and four open-source models. We achieve up to 25% savings in GPU-hours compared to the current baseline deployment and reduce GPU-hour wastage due to inefficient auto-scaling by 80%, resulting in a potential monthly cost savings of up to $2.5 million, while maintaining tail latency and meeting SLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConstrainedSQL: Training LLMs for Text2SQL via Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09693v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Embodied Agentic AI: Review and Classification of LLM- and VLM-Driven Robot Autonomy and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05294v4)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper reviews works that advance agentic applications and architectures, including initial efforts with GPT-style interfaces and more complex systems where AI agents function as coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Can We Effectively Use LLMs for Phishing Detection?: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Model-based Phishing Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09606v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising phishing detection mechanism, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based detectors, including poor generalization to previously unseen websites and a lack of interpretability. However, LLMs' effectiveness for phishing detection remains unexplored. This study investigates how to effectively leverage LLMs for phishing detection (including target brand identification) by examining the impact of input modalities (screenshots, logos, HTML, and URLs), temperature settings, and prompt engineering strategies. Using a dataset of 19,131 real-world phishing websites and 243 benign sites, we evaluate seven LLMs -- two commercial models (GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.0 flash) and five open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Janus, DeepSeek-VL2, and R1) -- alongside two deep learning (DL)-based baselines (PhishIntention and Phishpedia). Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples. For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%. However, incorporating multiple input modalities simultaneously or applying one-shot prompts does not consistently enhance performance and may degrade results. Furthermore, higher temperature values reduce performance. Based on these results, we recommend using screenshot inputs with zero temperature to maximize accuracy for LLM-based detectors with HTML serving as auxiliary context when screenshot information is insufficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLPD: Aligning LLMs to Human Language Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06942v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dfq2021/HLPD.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, accepted by AAAI'26</p></details> |
| **[Steve: LLM Powered ChatBot for Career Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03789v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancements in systems deploying large language models (LLMs), as well as improvements in their ability to act as agents with predefined templates, provide an opportunity to conduct qualitative, individualized assessments, creating a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methods for candidates seeking career progression. In this paper, we develop a platform that allows candidates to run AI-led interviews to assess their current career stage and curate coursework to enable progression to the next level. Our approach incorporates predefined career trajectories, associated skills, and a method to recommend the best resources for gaining the necessary skills for advancement. We employ OpenAI API calls along with expertly compiled chat templates to assess candidate competence. Our platform is highly configurable due to the modularity of the development, is easy to deploy and use, and available as a web interface where the only requirement is candidate resumes in PDF format. We demonstrate a use-case centered on software engineering and intend to extend this platform to be domain-agnostic, requiring only regular updates to chat templates as industries evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring The Interaction-Outcome Paradox: Seemingly Richer and More Self-Aware Interactions with LLMs May Not Yet Lead to Better Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09458v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs)-powered agents offer a promising solution by enabling dynamic task planning and predictive decision support. Despite recent advances, the absence of surgical agent datasets and robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques limits the development of LLM agents capable of complex intraoperative reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Surgical AI Copilot, an LLM agent for image-guided pituitary surgery, capable of conversation, planning, and task execution in response to queries involving tasks such as MRI tumor segmentation, endoscope anatomy segmentation, overlaying preoperative imaging with intraoperative views, instrument tracking, and surgical visual question answering (VQA). To enable structured agent planning, we develop the PitAgent dataset, a surgical context-aware planning dataset covering surgical tasks like workflow analysis, instrument localization, anatomical segmentation, and query-based reasoning. Additionally, we propose DEFT-GaLore, a Deterministic Energy-based Fourier Transform (DEFT) gradient projection technique for efficient low-rank adaptation of recent LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.2, Qwen 2.5), enabling their use as surgical agent planners. We extensively validate our agent's performance and the proposed adaptation technique against other state-of-the-art low-rank adaptation methods on agent planning and prompt generation tasks, including a zero-shot surgical VQA benchmark, demonstrating the significant potential for truly efficient and scalable surgical LLM agents in real-time operative settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[LLM-Guided Dynamic-UMAP for Personalized Federated Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09438v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.</p></details> |  |
