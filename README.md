| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

| **[Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Y.

| **[OPeRA: A Dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action for Evaluating LLMs on Human Online Shopping Behavior Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05606v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascade: Token-Sharded Private LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05228v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ICML 2025 Main Proceedings as "Hidden No More: Attacking and Defending Private Third-Party LLM Inference", together with arXiv:2505.18332</p></details> |
| **[Reviewing Scientific Papers for Critical Problems With Reasoning LLMs: Baseline Approaches and Automatic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23824v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models have sparked interest in utilizing them to aid the peer review process of scientific publication amid the peer review crisis. However, having AI models generate full reviews in the same way as human reviewers risks exacerbating the irresponsible use of LLM-generated reviews. As an alternative, we propose adopting LLMs as manuscript quality checkers. We introduce several baseline approaches and an extendable automatic evaluation framework using top reasoning LLMs as judges to tackle the difficulty of recruiting domain experts for manual evaluation. Utilizing papers withdrawn from arXiv, we validated our proposed methods with several leading reasoning LLMs from multiple vendors and assessed their performance and API costs for identifying critical errors and unsoundness problems in scientific papers. o3 exhibited the best problem identification performance among all models at a modest cost. This paper provides insights into document-based scientific understanding/reasoning and lays a foundation for future applications. Our dataset, code, and model outputs are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add r...</summary><p>Add results from new experiments; update discussion and GitHub link</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[NativQA Framework: Enabling LLMs with Native, Local, and Everyday Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05995v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose the NativQA framework, which can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages -- ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages -- resulting in over 300K Question-Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).</p></details> | <details><summary>LLMs,...</summary><p>LLMs, Native, Multilingual, Language Diversity, Contextual Understanding, Minority Languages, Culturally Informed, Foundation Models, Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[VerifyLLM: LLM-Based Pre-Execution Task Plan Verification for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05118v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available at https://verifyllm.github.io.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Can Video LLMs Refuse to Answer? Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04976v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[The Case for Instance-Optimized LLMs in OLAP Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04967v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance analytics systems with powerful data summarization, cleaning, and semantic transformation capabilities. However, deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs, IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Understand the Safety of Their Inputs? Training-Free Moderation via Latent Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16174v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of LLMs, ensuring model safety and alignment has become a critical concern. While modern instruction-finetuned LLMs incorporate alignment during training, they still frequently require moderation tools to prevent unsafe behavior. The most common approach to moderation are guard models that flag unsafe inputs. However, guards require costly training and are typically limited to fixed-size, pre-trained options, making them difficult to adapt to evolving risks and resource constraints. We hypothesize that instruction-finetuned LLMs already encode safety-relevant information internally and explore training-free safety assessment methods that work with off-the-shelf models. We show that simple prompting allows models to recognize harmful inputs they would otherwise mishandle. We also demonstrate that safe and unsafe prompts are distinctly separable in the models' latent space. Building on this, we introduce the Latent Prototype Moderator (LPM), a training-free moderation method that uses Mahalanobis distance in latent space to assess input safety. LPM is a lightweight, customizable add-on that generalizes across model families and sizes. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art guard models across multiple safety benchmarks, offering a practical and flexible solution for scalable LLM moderation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DoPI: Doctor-like Proactive Interrogation LLM for Traditional Chinese Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04877v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models (LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information. Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes, significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis while maintaining professional expertise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spec-TOD: A Specialized Instruction-Tuned LLM Framework for Efficient Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04841v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data. Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGdial 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Query Optimization via LLM-Based Plan Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05853v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free, embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ABench-Physics: Benchmarking Physical Reasoning in LLMs via High-Difficulty and Dynamic Physics Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04766v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions. All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as Architects and Critics for Multi-Source Opinion Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04751v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews. This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74, which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Question-Answer Framework for Sensor-driven HVAC System Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04748v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Frame: Query-aware Frame Selection and Multi-Resolution Adaptation for Video-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22139v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Who's the Mole? Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentXposed-F814.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Act: Prioritization Strategies for LLM-Designed Restless Bandit Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AKEGEN: A LLM-based Tabular Corpus Generator for Evaluating Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04687v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to generate a large, realistic set of tables along with joinability relationships, to stress-test dataset discovery methods? Dataset discovery methods aim to automatically identify related data assets in a data lake. The development and evaluation of such solutions for customers from a wide range of business domains, relies on diverse, high quality and domain-specific tabular benchmarks. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a wide variety of text data, which can provide a strong foundation of general and domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we ask the question -- \textit{can we leverage LLMs to generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery solutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables which is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current corpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of open data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very common and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do not contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize ground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and vertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column relationships.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[VectorLLM: Human-like Extraction of Structured Building Contours vis Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04664v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement, which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks, highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting community development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous User Modeling for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025</p></details> |

We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.</p></details> | ACL2025 Oral |
| **[Hierarchical Intent-guided Optimization with Pluggable LLM-Driven Semantics for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04623v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information, ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning. Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available: https://github.com/hjx159/HIPHOP.</p></details> |  |

While any4 does not require preprocessing of weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3 and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/any4 .</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We conjecture that expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory, sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences, developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates, contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics. The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the substantial challenges in implementing such a system.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 0 figures, position paper</p></details> |

This paper examines the open-source paradigm's critical role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience) by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial indexing), and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. However, the growing reliance on any LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. This paper argues that GIScience advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse, interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation, custom geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a thorough discourse on leveraging LLMs to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[DOTResize: Reducing LLM Width via Discrete Optimal Transport-based Neuron Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04517v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.</p></details> |  |

The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their applicability for scientific tasks offers new opportunities for researchers who are looking for data, e.g., to freely express their data needs instead of fitting them into restrictions of data catalogues and portals. However, this also creates uncertainty about whether LLMs are suitable for this task. To answer this question, we conducted a user study with 32 researchers. We qualitatively and quantitively analysed participants' information interaction behaviour while searching for data using LLMs in two data search tasks, one in which we prompted the LLM to behave as a persona. We found that participants interact with LLMs in natural language, but LLMs remain a tool for them rather than an equal conversational partner. This changes slightly when the LLM is prompted to behave as a persona, but the prompting only affects participants' user experience when they are already experienced in LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper at TPDL'25</p></details> |

While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

Surveying the NLP Community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09701v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised learning relies on annotated data, which is expensive to obtain. A longstanding strategy to reduce annotation costs is active learning, an iterative process, in which a human annotates only data instances deemed informative by a model. Large language models (LLMs) have pushed the effectiveness of active learning, while also advancing methods such as few- or zero-shot learning, and text synthesis -- all of which can reduce the need for active learning. This naturally raises the question: has active learning become obsolete? To answer this fully, we must look beyond literature to practical experiences. We conduct an online survey in the NLP community to collect previously intangible insights on the perceived relevance of data annotation, particularly focusing on active learning, including best practices, obstacles, and future prospects. Our findings show that annotated data is expected to remain a key factor and active learning to stay highly relevant while benefiting from LLMs. Consistent with a community survey from over a decade ago, however, we find that three key challenges persist -- setup complexity, risks in the cost reduction, and tooling -- for which we propose alleviation strategies. We publish an anonymized version of the collected dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04365v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

The Cantonese language used in Hong Kong presents unique challenges for natural language processing due to its rich cultural nuances and lack of dedicated evaluation datasets. The HKCanto-Eval benchmark addresses this gap by evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Cantonese language understanding tasks, extending to English and Written Chinese for cross-lingual evaluation. HKCanto-Eval integrates cultural and linguistic nuances intrinsic to Hong Kong, providing a robust framework for assessing language models in realistic scenarios. Additionally, the benchmark includes questions designed to tap into the underlying linguistic metaknowledge of the models. Our findings indicate that while proprietary models generally outperform open-weight models, significant limitations remain in handling Cantonese-specific linguistic and cultural knowledge, highlighting the need for more targeted training data and evaluation methods.

However, generating HLS code significantly differs from standard C/C++: it disallows certain coding idioms, relies on specialized libraries, and critically requires fine-grained transformations and the insertion of optimization directives (pragmas) to achieve high performance. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating such transformations, yet existing open-source datasets lack sufficient complexity and optimization diversity. To address this gap, we introduce the HLStrans dataset, a comprehensive collection of 137 distinct real word programs, each annotated with a variety of C-to-HLS transformations that yield over 23K labeled design variants. These include a broad spectrum of pragmas and code-level optimizations. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset to evaluate their ability to generate synthesizable, high-performance HLS code. As part of an ongoing effort, we plan to expand the HLStrans dataset in both scale and program variety, further empowering research at the intersection of AI and hardware synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements, the integration of LLMs raises severe fairness concerns. Existing studies reveal that LLM-based RSs exhibit greater unfairness than traditional RSs, yet fairness issues in LLM-enhanced RSs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, our empirical study reveals that while LLM-enhanced RSs improve fairness across item groups, a significant fairness gap persists. Further enhancement remains challenging due to the architectural differences and varying sources of unfairness inherent in LLM-enhanced RSs. To bridge this gap, we first decompose unfairness into i) \textit{prior unfairness} in LLM-generated representations and ii) \textit{training unfairness} in recommendation models. Then, we propose BiFair, a bi-level optimization-based fairness-aware training framework designed to mitigate both prior and training unfairness simultaneously. BiFair optimizes two sets of learnable parameters: LLM-generated representations and a trainable projector in the recommendation model, using a two-level nested optimization process. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive inter-group balancing mechanism, leveraging multi-objective optimization principles to dynamically balance fairness across item groups. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that BiFair significantly mitigates unfairness and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Current efforts predominantly focus on RTL generation and basic debugging, overlooking the critical domain of functional verification, which is the primary bottleneck in modern design methodologies due to the rapid escalation of hardware complexity. We present FIXME, the first end-to-end, multi-model, and open-source evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance in hardware functional verification (FV) to address this crucial gap. FIXME introduces a structured three-level difficulty hierarchy spanning six verification sub-domains and 180 diverse tasks, enabling in-depth analysis across the design lifecycle. Leveraging a collaborative AI-human approach, we construct a high-quality dataset using 100% silicon-proven designs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world challenges. Furthermore, we enhance the functional coverage by 45.57% through expert-guided optimization. By rigorously evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude3, and LlaMA3, we identify key areas for improvement and outline promising research directions to unlock the full potential of LLM-driven automation in hardware design verification.

| **[LLMs' Reading Comprehension Is Affected by Parametric Knowledge and Struggles with Hypothetical Statements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06283v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive. If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information. Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities. This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge. Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios. While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts. Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again. In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable AI for Mental Health Emergency Returns: Integrating LLMs with Predictive Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00025v4)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Importance: Emergency department (ED) returns for mental health conditions pose a major healthcare burden, with 24-27% of patients returning within 30 days. Traditional machine learning models for predicting these returns often lack interpretability for clinical use. Objective: To assess whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with machine learning improves predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health return risk models. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an academic medical center in the Deep South from January 2018 to December 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30-day ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability using a novel LLM-enhanced framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with clinical knowledge. Results: For chief complaint classification, LLaMA 3 (8B) with 10-shot learning outperformed traditional models (accuracy: 0.882, F1-score: 0.86). In SDoH classification, LLM-based models achieved 0.95 accuracy and 0.96 F1-score, with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Substance Abuse performing best (F1: 0.96-0.89), while Exercise and Home Environment showed lower performance (F1: 0.70-0.67). The LLM-based interpretability framework achieved 99% accuracy in translating model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. LLM-extracted features improved XGBoost AUC from 0.74 to 0.76 and AUC-PR from 0.58 to 0.61. Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with machine learning models yielded modest but consistent accuracy gains while significantly enhancing interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach provides a framework for translating predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.</p></details> |  |

We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Initially embraced by the computer science community, the versatility of LLMs has found its way into diverse domains. In particular, the software engineering realm has witnessed the most transformative changes. With LLMs increasingly serving as AI Pair Programming Assistants spurred the development of specialized models aimed at aiding software engineers. Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also presents critical challenges and open problems. To identify the potential and prevailing obstacles, we systematically reviewed contemporary scholarly publications, emphasizing the perspectives of software developers and usability concerns. Preliminary findings underscore pressing concerns about data privacy, bias, and misinformation.

The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction (NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and practical solution for the current technological landscape.</p></details> |  |

We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in real-world, high-stakes environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted by Chinese Journal of Aeronautics</p></details> |

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairSteer: Inference Time Debiasing for LLMs with Dynamic Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14492v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are prone to capturing biases from training corpus, leading to potential negative social impacts. Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space. FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering. Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small contrastive prompt pairs. Subsequently, it performs debiasing by adjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage. Comprehensive evaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across question-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text generation tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale, Independent and Comprehensive study of the power of LLMs for test case generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00225v3)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for software reliability, yet manual test creation is time-consuming and often neglected. Although search-based software testing improves efficiency, it produces tests with poor readability and maintainability. Although LLMs show promise for test generation, existing research lacks comprehensive evaluation across execution-driven assessment, reasoning-based prompting, and real-world testing scenarios. This study presents the first large-scale empirical evaluation of LLM-generated unit tests at the class level, systematically analyzing four state-of-the-art models - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B - against EvoSuite across 216,300 test cases from Defects4J, SF110, and CMD (a dataset mitigating LLM training data leakage). We evaluate five prompting techniques - Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), Few-Shot Learning (FSL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Guided Tree-of-Thought (GToT) - assessing syntactic correctness, compilability, hallucination-driven failures, readability, code coverage metrics, and fault detection capabilities. Our findings challenge prior claims that in-context learning is ineffective for test generation in code-specialized LLMs. Reasoning-based prompting - particularly GToT - significantly enhances test reliability, compilability, and structural adherence in general-purpose LLMs. However, hallucination-driven failures remain a persistent challenge, manifesting as non-existent symbol references, incorrect API calls, and fabricated dependencies, resulting in high compilation failure rates (up to 86%). Execution-based classification and mutation testing reveal that many failing tests stem from hallucinated dependencies, limiting effective fault detection.</p></details> |  |

Existing data synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub stars.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Improving RL Exploration for LLM Reasoning through Retrospective Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14363v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly become a pivotal technique in the post-training of large language models (LLMs). The effective exploration of the output space is essential for the success of RL. We observe that for complex problems, during the early stages of training, the model exhibits strong exploratory capabilities and can identify promising solution ideas. However, its limited capability at this stage prevents it from successfully solving these problems. The early suppression of these potentially valuable solution ideas by the policy gradient hinders the model's ability to revisit and re-explore these ideas later. Consequently, although the LLM's capabilities improve in the later stages of training, it still struggles to effectively address these complex problems. To address this exploration issue, we propose a novel algorithm named Retrospective Replay-based Reinforcement Learning (RRL), which introduces a dynamic replay mechanism throughout the training process. RRL enables the model to revisit promising states identified in the early stages, thereby improving its efficiency and effectiveness in exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of RRL, we conduct extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation, and general dialogue tasks. The results indicate that RRL maintains high exploration efficiency throughout the training period, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of RL in optimizing LLMs for complicated reasoning tasks. Moreover, it also improves the performance of RLHF, making the model both safer and more helpful.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CCIR25 and published by Springer LNCS or LNAI</p></details> |
| **[Function-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation: Definition, Annotation, and LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03945v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementary recommendations enhance the user experience by suggesting items that are frequently purchased together while serving different functions from the query item. Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary relationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining these labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such relationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs attempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and unreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs) to infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary classification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels (FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user purchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a human-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that it covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then evaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could accurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated complementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that even with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve high macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as gpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy (0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as effective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents FBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more accurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Vision and Language: Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report Generation via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03908v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology report generation represents a significant application within medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \& Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG) and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03876v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) -- represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science should engage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Adaptive Behavioral Interventions with LLM Inference from Participant-Described States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03871v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion. However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials. In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC) 2025</p></details> |

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Economic Evaluation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03834v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds \$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models, practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, their use in research has been met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use. Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.</p></details> |  |

Through experimentation with models like Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan moves, and manage dynamic game states.

These results prompted concerns about the emergence of harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms. Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that preserve intended behavior across domains.</p></details> |  |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Robustness of LLMs to Paraphrasing Based on Sociodemographic Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08276v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their linguistic prowess, LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to small input perturbations. While robustness to local adversarial changes has been studied, robustness to global modifications such as different linguistic styles remains underexplored. Therefore, we take a broader approach to explore a wider range of variations across sociodemographic dimensions. We extend the SocialIQA dataset to create diverse paraphrased sets conditioned on sociodemographic factors (age and gender). The assessment aims to provide a deeper understanding of LLMs in (a) their capability of generating demographic paraphrases with engineered prompts and (b) their capabilities in interpreting real-world, complex language scenarios. We also perform a reliability analysis of the generated paraphrases looking into linguistic diversity and perplexity as well as manual evaluation. We find that demographic-based paraphrasing significantly impacts the performance of language models, indicating that the subtleties of linguistic variation remain a significant challenge. We will make the code and dataset available for future research.</p></details> |  |

We propose ArithmAttack to examine how robust the LLMs are when they encounter noisy prompts that contain extra noise in the form of punctuation marks. While being easy to implement, ArithmAttack does not cause any information loss since words are not added or deleted from the context. We evaluate the robustness of eight LLMs, including LLama3, Mistral, Mathstral, and DeepSeek on noisy GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Our experiments suggest that all the studied models show vulnerability to such noise, with more noise leading to poorer performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LLMSEC Workshop at ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Blackbox Dataset Inference for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03619v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the training of large language models (LLMs) can involve personally identifiable information and copyrighted material, incurring dataset misuse. To mitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \textit{dataset inference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\mathcal{M}$ used a victim dataset $\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference by aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to determine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset. However, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates grey-box access to $\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities, loss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to reduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have limited incentives to return the intermediate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only black-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based responses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets of locally built reference models, one set involving $\mathcal{D}$ in training and the other not. By measuring which set of reference model $\mathcal{M}$ is closer to, we determine if $\mathcal{M}$ used $\mathcal{D}$ for training. Evaluations of real-world LLMs in the wild show that our method offers high accuracy in all settings and presents robustness against bypassing attempts.</p></details> |  |

Despite various fusion methods, no standard metric exists to assess this alignment.

Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration, exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis combines behaviour-based projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features, performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks. The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm generators.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focused on Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd) dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of 15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of explicitly considering certain linguistic features.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 student research workshop</p></details> |

We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Read Quietly, Think Aloud: Decoupling Comprehension and Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03327v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal `reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text). Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs with a similar capacity for internal processing. We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.' Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a `reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy boost.</p></details> | Under submission |

However, commercial design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more. In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality. Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input, MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewriting Pre-Training Data Boosts LLM Performance in Math and Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02881v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Optimized CXL-Attached Memory Allocation for Long-Context LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03305v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their substantial memory requirements have prompted renewed interest in CPU offloading as a method to compensate for limited GPU memory. In particular, when CPU memory is leveraged to temporarily store intermediate states of LLMs, CPU memory becomes a new bottleneck and soon reaches the capacity limitation of commodity CPUs. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Compute Express Link (CXL) add-in card (AIC) memory as an extension to CPU memory, enabling larger model sizes and longer context lengths during fine-tuning. Through extensive benchmarking, this study quantifies the performance overhead introduced by transferring data between CXL memory, CPU, and GPUs, focusing on how concurrency and data volume influence bandwidth utilization and latency. This study also compares CPUbased optimizer steps when model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states reside in local memory versus CXL memory, revealing that naive adoption of CXL often degrades performance during the optimizer phase. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a CXL-aware allocation to strategically partition CPU offloading workloads across both local and CXL memory. This study further demonstrates that employing multiple AICs significantly reduces bandwidth contention, thus improving scalability. Experimental results show that these optimizations enable efficient long-context LLM fine-tuning, underscoring CXL as a promising avenue for unlocking the full potential of CPU offloading in long-context LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

As a promising direction, low-rank approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless, unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process. MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs, allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics, ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting remarkable performance improvements.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.</p></details> |  |

However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models. These findings highlight the importance of considering moral reasoning in the development and evaluation of LLMs, as well as the need for ongoing research to address the biases and limitations uncovered in our study.

However, existing structured prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings, and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic, and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA, HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36 percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition, our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%, respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The speedup ratio of the CPU operators has an average improvemnet of 43.8\%, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOCABTRIM: Vocabulary Pruning for Efficient Speculative Decoding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22694v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, accepted at ICML 2025 workshop on Efficient Systems for Foundational Models</p></details> |

While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies: (1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in https://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2.</p></details> |  |

Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions that address LLM limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures. to be submitted to AACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[One Demo Is All It Takes: Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs from A Single Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18382v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving planning problems but often struggle to ensure plan correctness, especially for long-horizon tasks. Meanwhile, traditional robotic task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address these challenges more reliably by combining high-level symbolic search with low-level motion planning. At the core of TAMP is the planning domain, an abstract world representation defined through symbolic predicates and actions. However, creating these domains typically involves substantial manual effort and domain expertise, limiting generalizability. We introduce Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a novel approach that combines simulated physical interaction with LLM reasoning to improve planning performance. The method reduces reliance on humans by inferring planning domains from a single annotated task-execution demonstration. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains entirely from scratch and automatically integrates them with low-level motion planning skills, enabling fully automated long-horizon planning. PDDLLM is evaluated on over 1,200 diverse tasks spanning nine environments and benchmarked against six LLM-based planning baselines, demonstrating superior long-horizon planning performance, lower token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (9 paper, 2 references, 3 annexes).

| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

| **[HGCA: Hybrid GPU-CPU Attention for Long Context LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03153v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV) caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable, high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on commodity GPU hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIAR: Leveraging Inference Time Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05232v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks expose vulnerabilities in safety-aligned LLMs by eliciting harmful outputs through carefully crafted prompts. Existing methods rely on discrete optimization or trained adversarial generators, but are slow, compute-intensive, and often impractical. We argue that these inefficiencies stem from a mischaracterization of the problem. Instead, we frame jailbreaks as inference-time misalignment and introduce LIAR (Leveraging Inference-time misAlignment to jailbReak), a fast, black-box, best-of-$N$ sampling attack requiring no training. LIAR matches state-of-the-art success rates while reducing perplexity by $10\times$ and Time-to-Attack from hours to seconds. We also introduce a theoretical "safety net against jailbreaks" metric to quantify safety alignment strength and derive suboptimality bounds. Our work offers a simple yet effective tool for evaluating LLM robustness and advancing alignment research.</p></details> |  |
