| **[Let's Measure Information Step-by-Step: LLM-Based Evaluation Beyond Vibes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05469v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study evaluation of AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a link between strategic gaming and information loss. We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add A...</summary><p>Add AUC results, pre-reg conformance, theory section clarification. 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[SycEval: Evaluating LLM Sycophancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08177v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.</p></details> | AIES 2025 |
| **[LLM-empowered Dynamic Prompt Routing for Vision-Language Models Tuning under Long-Tailed Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15688v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[VerilogLAVD: LLM-Aided Rule Generation for Vulnerability Detection in Verilog](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13092v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data. In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types, VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairwise or Pointwise? Evaluating Feedback Protocols for Bias in LLM-Based Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14716v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Injection Attack to Tool Selection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19793v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, published at SemEval-2025 workshop Task 5: LLMs4Subjects: https://aclanthology.org/2025.semeval-1.315/</p></details> |
| **[Seed-X: Building Strong Multilingual Translation LLM with 7B Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13618v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafetyFlow: An Agent-Flow System for Automated LLM Safety Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15526v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yangyangyang127/SafetyFlow</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation Guidelines for Empirical Studies in Software Engineering involving LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15503v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should) criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning; (3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7) to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft of evaluation guidelines for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs (see also llm-guidelines.org)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Self-Refinement for Embodied Drone Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15501v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations. Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience. Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is available at https://github.com/ZXiiiC/SRDrone.</p></details> | 14pages |
| **[SynthCoder: A Synthetical Strategy to Tune LLMs for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15495v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AraReasoner: Evaluating Reasoning-Based LLMs for Arabic NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08768v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

| **[Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15474v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Unlearning Harmful Information in LLMs with Metamorphosis Representation Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15449v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/ChengcanWu/MRP.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, Under review as a full paper at AAAI 2026.

This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate complex business landscapes more effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC) Improving LLMs' Reasoning of Authentic Implicit Toxic Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01539v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and rule-based baselines. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study on How Video-LLMs Answer Video Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15360v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory for LLM Agent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15305v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning.

Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i) multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request, mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile, it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence (AGI) in image compression.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a dataset comprising around 60% non-English data and utilizing a custom multilingual tokenizer, our models address the limitations of existing LLMs that predominantly focus on English or a few high-resource languages. We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate strong performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints. R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically, strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCA-RG: Enhancing LLMs with Medical Concept Alignment for Radiology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06992v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

However, existing tools still encounter several challenges, such as misinterpretation of user intent, generation of hallucinated content, and the absence of effective mechanisms for human feedback-all of which undermine their reliability and practical utility. To address these issues and promote a more transparent and controllable querying experience, we proposed QueryGenie, an interactive system that enables users to monitor, understand, and guide the LLM-driven query generation process. Through incremental reasoning, real-time validation, and responsive interaction mechanisms, users can iteratively refine query logic and ensure alignment with their intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST Adjunct '25), September 28-October 1, 2025, Busan, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings. In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025; *These authors contributed equally</p></details> |

We consider and emphasize the unique opportunities, challenges, and potential pathways in insurance amid rapid performance improvements, increased open-source access, decreasing deployment costs, and the complexity of LLM or agentic AI frameworks. To bring it closer to home, we identify critical gaps in the African insurance market and highlight key local efforts, players, and partnership opportunities. Finally, we call upon actuaries, insurers, regulators, and tech leaders to a collaborative effort aimed at creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable AI strategies and solutions: by and for Africans.</p></details> |  |
| **[It's the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02873v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

While large-scale datasets on online abuse exist, there remains a significant gap in labeled data that specifically reflects the language and communication styles used by children. The acquisition of such data from vulnerable populations, such as children, is challenging due to ethical, legal and technical barriers. Moreover, the creation of these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant concerns due to annotators exposure to harmful content. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recent advancements of MLLMs, they still often falter when interpreting intricately structured information, such as nested tables and multi-dimensional plots, leading to hallucinations and erroneous outputs. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs in understanding and answering questions from complex data structures found in PDF documents by leveraging industrial and open-source tools as part of a pre-processing pipeline. Our findings indicate that GPT-4o, a popular MLLM, achieves an accuracy of 56% on multi-structured documents when fed documents directly, and that integrating pre-processing tools raises the accuracy of LLMs to 61.3% for GPT-4o and 76% for GPT-4, and with lower overall cost.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |

In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Using Sotopia as a simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions. Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics, specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems.

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets, restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERAKLES: Hierarchical Skill Compilation for Open-ended LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14751v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.</p></details> | 42 pages |

We present a controlled evaluation framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever for improving multilingual robustness.

As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>UQLM ...</summary><p>UQLM repository: https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper with individual presentation at LUHME workshop at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.</p></details> |  |

Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency. Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including appendix, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Can LLM Agents Solve Collaborative Tasks? A Study on Urgency-Aware Planning and Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14635v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and architectural improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[EoH-S: Evolution of Heuristic Set using LLMs for Automated Heuristic Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03082v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances, often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings. To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances, such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics. Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\% performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEM: Efficient Relative Capability Evaluation of LLMs through Structured Transition Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12096v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI 2026 |
| **[Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.</p></details> | Accepted at ICSR25 |
| **[Towards LLM-generated explanations for Component-based Knowledge Graph Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14553v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components, enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations (automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF and SPARQL as a context for explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWI 2024, Zagreb.

| **[Critique-GRPO: Advancing LLM Reasoning with Natural Language and Numerical Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03106v5)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks. Specifically, Critique-GRPO improves average pass@1 scores across all compared methods by approximately +4.4% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and +3.8% on Qwen3-8B. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing, achieving significant gains over GRPO, e.g., +16.7% pass@1 improvement on AIME 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, updated with new experimental results and implementation details</p></details> |
| **[Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request. We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSpark: Leveraging Previous Data Reports as References to Generate New Reports with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02329v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating data reports is a labor-intensive task involving iterative data exploration, insight extraction, and narrative construction. A key challenge lies in composing the analysis logic-from defining objectives and transforming data to identifying and communicating insights. Manually crafting this logic can be cognitively demanding. While experienced analysts often reuse scripts from past projects, finding a perfect match for a new dataset is rare. Even when similar analyses are available online, they usually share only results or visualizations, not the underlying code, making reuse difficult. To address this, we present ReSpark, a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to reverse-engineer analysis logic from existing reports and adapt it to new datasets. By generating draft analysis steps, ReSpark provides a warm start for users. It also supports interactive refinement, allowing users to inspect intermediate outputs, insert objectives, and revise content. We evaluate ReSpark through comparative and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in lowering the barrier to generating data reports without relying on existing analysis code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Energy: Detecting LLM Hallucination Beyond Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14496v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14460v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures, |

However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability, readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive Surgery: The Awakening of Implicit Territorial Awareness in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14408v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However, performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm (IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZPD-SCA: Unveiling the Blind Spots of LLMs in Assessing Students' Cognitive Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14377v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore, significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.</p></details> |  |

While the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is widely used in industry to improve verification efficiency through structured and reusable testbenches, constructing these testbenches and generating sufficient stimuli remain challenging. These challenges arise from the considerable manual coding effort required, repetitive manual execution of multiple EDA tools, and the need for in-depth domain expertise to navigate complex designs.Here, we present UVM^2, an automated verification framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate UVM testbenches and iteratively refine them using coverage feedback, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining rigorous verification standards.To evaluate UVM^2, we introduce a benchmark suite comprising Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs of up to 1.6K lines of code.The results show that UVM^2 reduces testbench setup time by up to UVM^2 compared to experienced engineers, and achieve average code and function coverage of 87.44% and 89.58%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 20.96% and 23.51%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |

We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics. Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary predictors or adding any inference overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring LLM Code Generation Stability via Structural Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14288v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs) is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation evaluation toolkit.</p></details> | ASE-NIER |

This highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention. Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following, reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex, interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at improving these critical capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate, university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i) selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3 orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as long paper @RANLP2025</p></details> |

We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles, abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source (DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap, semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4 Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing.

| **[Is The Watermarking Of LLM-Generated Code Robust?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17983v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first in depth study on the robustness of existing watermarking techniques applied to code generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs increasingly contribute to software development, watermarking has emerged as a potential solution for detecting AI generated code and mitigating misuse, such as plagiarism or the automated generation of malicious programs. While previous research has demonstrated the resilience of watermarking in the text setting, our work reveals that watermarking techniques are significantly more fragile in code-based contexts. Specifically, we show that simple semantic-preserving transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code insertion, can effectively erase watermarks without altering the program's functionality. To systematically evaluate watermark robustness, we develop an algorithm that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a watermarked program and applies a sequence of randomized, semantics-preserving transformations. Our experimental results, conducted on Python code generated by different LLMs, indicate that even minor modifications can drastically reduce watermark detectability, with true positive rates (TPR) dropping below 50% in many cases.

| **[DeepRetro: Retrosynthetic Pathway Discovery using Iterative LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07060v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs. In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug discovery, materials design, and beyond.</p></details> | 64 pages, |
| **[Two Birds with One Stone: Multi-Task Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14190v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship attribution.</p></details> | Securecomm 2025 |
| **[Contextualizing Recommendation Explanations with LLMs: A User Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12152v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in recommender systems, where LLMs can be used to generate personalized recommendations. Here, we examine how different LLM-generated explanations for movie recommendations affect users' perceptions of cognitive, affective, and utilitarian needs and consumption intentions. In a pre-registered, between-subject online experiment (N=759) and follow-up interviews (N=30), we compare (a) LLM-generated generic explanations, and (b) LLM-generated contextualized explanations. Our findings show that contextualized explanations (i.e., explanations that incorporate users' past behaviors) effectively meet users' cognitive needs while increasing users' intentions to watch recommended movies. However, adding explanations offers limited benefits in meeting users' utilitarian and affective needs, raising concerns about the proper design and implications of LLM-generated explanations. Qualitative insights from interviews reveal that referencing users' past preferences enhances trust and understanding but can feel excessive if overused. Furthermore, users with more active and positive engagement with the recommender system and movie-watching get substantial gains from contextualized explanations. Overall, our research clarifies how LLM-generated recommendations influence users' motivations and behaviors, providing valuable insights for the future development of user-centric recommender systems, a key element in social media platforms and online ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[MMReview: A Multidisciplinary and Multimodal Benchmark for LLM-Based Peer Review Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14146v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Chunks as Arms: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Sampling for Long-Context LLM Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13993v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks, including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses. Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks. All code and data will be released on https://github.com/NEUIR/LongMab-PO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring LLMs for Automated Generation and Adaptation of Questionnaires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05985v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective questionnaire design improves the validity of the results, but creating and adapting questionnaires across contexts is challenging due to resource constraints and limited expert access. Recently, the emergence of LLMs has led researchers to explore their potential in survey research. In this work, we focus on the suitability of LLMs in assisting the generation and adaptation of questionnaires. We introduce a novel pipeline that leverages LLMs to create new questionnaires, pretest with a target audience to determine potential issues and adapt existing standardized questionnaires for different contexts. We evaluated our pipeline for creation and adaptation through two studies on Prolific, involving 238 participants from the US and 118 participants from South Africa. Our findings show that participants found LLM-generated text clearer, LLM-pretested text more specific, and LLM-adapted questions slightly clearer and less biased than traditional ones. Our work opens new opportunities for LLM-driven questionnaire support in survey research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI '25)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Powered Virtual Patient Agents for Interactive Clinical Skills Training with Automated Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13943v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are essential for medical training, but they require significant resources, including professional actors and expert medical feedback. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these simulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions. This paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based simulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more realistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore, our system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant, personalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated encounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's real-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy. Preliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and coherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and appropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments. This innovative system provides medical students with a low-cost, accessible platform for personalized OSCE preparation at home.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMind 2.0: Distributed IoT Automation with Natural Language M2M Communication and Lightweight LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13920v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating device management through natural language instructions. However, existing centralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing and coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities in large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a distributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges through lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled automation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate device-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0 distributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs embedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions into simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then processed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at the associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers by using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless collaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system incorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution framework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and real-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in scalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARE: Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders for LLM-based Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13889v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero- or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries, but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space, resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts, producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.</p></details> |  |

We present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters (Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens), XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt, surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.</p></details> | 18 pages |

| **[Can Large Language Models (LLMs) Describe Pictures Like Children? A Comparative Corpus Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13769v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity, highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns. The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed educational tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration for Medical Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13754v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage, we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage, we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Organizing Agent Network for LLM-based Workflow Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13732v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths. Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore, developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Utility Judgment Framework via LLMs Inspired by Relevance in Philosophy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11290v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relevance and utility are two frequently used measures to evaluate the effectiveness of an information retrieval (IR) system. Relevance emphasizes the aboutness of a result to a query, while utility refers to the result's usefulness or value to an information seeker. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), high-utility results should be prioritized to feed to LLMs due to their limited input bandwidth. Re-examining RAG's three core components -- relevance ranking derived from retrieval models, utility judgments, and answer generation -- aligns with Schutz's philosophical system of relevances, which encompasses three types of relevance representing different levels of human cognition that enhance each other. These three RAG components also reflect three cognitive levels for LLMs in question-answering. Therefore, we propose an Iterative utiliTy judgmEnt fraMework (ITEM) to promote each step in RAG. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval (TREC DL, WebAP), utility judgment task (GTI-NQ), and factoid question-answering (NQ) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of ITEM in utility judgments, ranking, and answer generation upon representative baselines.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive semantic understanding capabilities, making them attractive to researchers focusing on dense retrieval. While LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, excel in language generation, they often fall short in modeling global information due to a lack of attention to subsequent tokens. Drawing inspiration from the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, specifically the query likelihood (QL) model, we aim to leverage the generative strengths of LLMs through QL maximization. Rather than employing QL estimation for document ranking, we propose an auxiliary task of QL maximization to enhance the backbone for subsequent contrastive learning of the retriever. We introduce our model, LLM-QL, which incorporates two key components: Attention Block (AB) and Document Corruption (DC). AB blocks the attention of predictive tokens to the document tokens before the document's ending token, while DC corrupts a document by masking a portion of its tokens during prediction. Evaluations on the in-domain (MS MARCO) and out-of-domain dataset (BEIR) indicate LLM-QL's superiority over other LLM-based retrievers. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses also validate the efficacy of LLM-QL and its components.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Hidden Cost of Readability: How Code Formatting Silently Consumes Your LLM Budget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13666v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code, achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to 36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE'26 (First Cycle)</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p></details> |  |

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL systems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus on test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g., coverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can serve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to effectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large Language Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis LLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple feedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware simulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation, enriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically repair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most popular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line code coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox). By the time of submission, FUEL has detected 104 previously unknown bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 49 already fixed, and 5 assigned CVE IDs.

Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii) Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR) reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task. To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, our experiments also show the 3D-stacked architecture faces severer thermal issues compared to 2D architecture, in terms of thermal temperature, gradient and scalability. To better exploit the potential of 3D-stacked architecture, we present Tasa, a heterogeneous architecture with cross-stack thermal optimizations to balance the temperature distribution and maximize the performance under the thermal constraints. High-performance core is designed for compute-intensive operations, while high-efficiency core is used for memory-intensive operators, e.g. attention layers. Furthermore, we propose a bandwidth sharing scheduling to improve the bandwidth utilization in such heterogeneous architecture. Extensive thermal experiments show that our Tasa architecture demonstrates greater scalability compared with the homogeneous 3D-stacked architecture, i.e. up to 5.55 $\tccentigrade$, 9.37 $\tccentigrade$, and 7.91 $\tccentigrade$ peak temperature reduction for 48, 60, and 72 core configurations. Our experimental for Llama-65B and GPT-3 66B inferences also demonstrate 2.85x and 2.21x speedup are obtained over the GPU baselines and state-of-the-art heterogeneous PIM-based LLM accelerator</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some data inaccuracies in section V</p></details> |

To address these issues, speculative inference and processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have been explored at the algorithmic and hardware levels. However, speculative inference results in more compute-intensive GEMM operations, creating new design trade-offs for existing GEMV-accelerated PIM architectures. Furthermore, there exists a significant amount of redundant draft tokens in tree-based speculative inference, necessitating efficient token management schemes to minimize energy consumption. In this work, we present LP-Spec, an architecture-dataflow co-design leveraging hybrid LPDDR5 performance-enhanced PIM architecture with draft token pruning and dynamic workload scheduling to accelerate LLM speculative inference. A near-data memory controller is proposed to enable data reallocation between DRAM and PIM banks. Furthermore, a data allocation unit based on the hardware-aware draft token pruner is developed to minimize energy consumption and fully exploit parallel execution opportunities. Compared to end-to-end LLM inference on other mobile solutions such as mobile NPUs or GEMV-accelerated PIMs, our LP-Spec achieves 13.21x, 7.56x, and 99.87x improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and energy-delay-product (EDP). Compared with prior AttAcc PIM and RTX 3090 GPU, LP-Spec can obtain 12.83x and 415.31x EDP reduction benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some data inaccuracies in section III</p></details> |
