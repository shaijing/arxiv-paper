| **[Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vila-lab.github.io/elastic-cache-webpage/</p></details> |
| **[TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14972v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At 33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MetaBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for Assessing LLMs in Metabolomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14944v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways, heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Within molecular design for pharmaceutical development, these models can propose innovative molecular modifications but frequently generate chemically infeasible structures. We introduce VALID-Mol, a comprehensive framework that integrates chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design, achieving an improvement in valid chemical structure generation from 3% to 83%. Our methodology synthesizes systematic prompt optimization, automated chemical verification, and domain-adapted fine-tuning to ensure dependable generation of synthesizable molecules with enhanced properties. Our contribution extends beyond implementation details to provide a transferable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications with measurable reliability enhancements. Computational analyses indicate our framework generates promising synthesis candidates with up to 17-fold predicted improvements in target binding affinity while preserving synthetic feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 1 algorithm, 5 tables, to be published in ISPACS 2025, unabridged version exists as arXiv:2506.23339v1</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13091v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20921v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical process optimization maximizes production efficiency and economic performance, but optimization algorithms, including gradient-based solvers, numerical methods, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable. We present a multi-agent LLM framework that autonomously infers operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guides optimization. Our AutoGen-based framework employs OpenAI's o3 model with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation, and optimization guidance. Through autonomous constraint generation and iterative multi-agent optimization, the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on hydrodealkylation across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework achieved competitive performance with conventional methods while reducing wall-time 31-fold relative to grid search, converging in under 20 minutes. The reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. Unlike conventional methods requiring predefined constraints, our approach uniquely combines autonomous constraint generation with interpretable parameter exploration. Model comparison reveals reasoning-capable architectures (o3, o1) are essential for successful optimization, while standard models fail to converge. This approach is particularly valuable for emerging processes and retrofit applications where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (main manuscript without references), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LLMs, IDEs, and Semantic Embeddings for Automated Move Method Refactoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20934v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools that recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not align with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive training of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code, they should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and which classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations revealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80% of the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered assistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end lifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that automatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a novel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank refactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global, projectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing refactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist, synergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and semantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we compare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist significantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other researchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a corpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates improve by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced participants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They rated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist is both effective and useful.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME'25)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness to Bias Elicitation in Large Language Models: Scalable Automated Assessment with LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07887v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases that can perpetuate stereotypes and undermine fairness. Such biases may stem from historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically probing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety vulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that training and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety gains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than their general-purpose counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pluto: A Benchmark for Evaluating Efficiency of LLM-generated Hardware Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14756v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively: they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching 78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive progress in hardware-focused LLM research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Multi-Token Prediction: Pretraining LLMs with Future Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14751v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models (LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training. Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP), which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left. Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Beyond the Surface: Enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge Alignment with Human via Internal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03550v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as "LLM-as-a-judge". However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on shallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc, plug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge point-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring no impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of LAGER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Last Dependency Crusade: Solving Python Dependency Conflicts with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16191v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resolving Python dependency issues remains a tedious and error-prone process, forcing developers to manually trial compatible module versions and interpreter configurations. Existing automated solutions, such as knowledge-graph-based and database-driven methods, face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically repair dependency issues in Python programs. We propose PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that iteratively infers missing or incorrect dependencies. PLLM builds a test environment where the LLM proposes module combinations, observes execution feedback, and refines its predictions using natural language processing (NLP) to parse error messages. We evaluate PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a curated collection of real-world Python programs. Using this benchmark, we explore multiple PLLM configurations, including six open-source LLMs evaluated both with and without RAG. Our findings show that RAG consistently improves fix rates, with the best performance achieved by Gemma-2 9B when combined with RAG. Compared to two state-of-the-art baselines, PyEGo and ReadPyE, PLLM achieves significantly higher fix rates; +15.97\% more than ReadPyE and +21.58\% more than PyEGo. Further analysis shows that PLLM is especially effective for projects with numerous dependencies and those using specialized numerical or machine-learning libraries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print - Accepted at the first annual workshop on Agentic Software Engineering (AgenticSE) co-located with ASE'25</p></details> |
| **[LLM Agents for Automated Web Vulnerability Reproduction: Are We There Yet?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14700v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software engineering and cybersecurity tasks, including code generation, vulnerability discovery, and automated testing. One critical but underexplored application is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms vulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest promising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web vulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web vulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software engineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including technical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors, on 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three top-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation on our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types and 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve reasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently fail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component environments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers create a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual vulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with performance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information. Our findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent capabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction, emphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous problem-solving capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Budget Allocation for Orthogonal-Subspace Adapter Tuning in LLMs Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22358v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter achieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks comprising 15 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence-Based Response Abstinence: Improving LLM Trustworthiness via Activation-Based Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13750v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Uncer...</summary><p>UncertaiNLP at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Augmenting Smart Contract Decompiler Output through Fine-grained Dependency Analysis and LLM-facilitated Semantic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08670v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system{} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author version of the article accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[The simulation of judgment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04426v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability--a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please refer to published version: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2518443122</p></details> |

Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right" subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional mathematicians.</p></details> |  |

Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14628v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made prematurely.

| **[Following the Autoregressive Nature of LLM Embeddings via Compression and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11401v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReMindRAG: Low-Cost LLM-Guided Knowledge Graph Traversal for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13193v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

| **[Assessing Socio-Cultural Alignment and Technical Safety of Sovereign LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14565v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well. We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader range of well-grounded and practical criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agents Beyond Utility: An Open-Ended Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14548v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LinguDiver.</p></details> |  |

These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03867v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

In this work, (i) We present the first large-scale study of third-person honorific pronoun and verb usage across 10,000 Hindi and Bengali Wikipedia articles with annotations linked to key socio-demographic attributes of the subjects, including gender, age group, fame, and cultural origin. (ii) Our analysis uncovers systematic intra-language regularities but notable cross-linguistic differences: honorifics are more prevalent in Bengali than in Hindi, while non-honorifics dominate while referring to infamous, juvenile, and culturally exotic entities. Notably, in both languages, and more prominently in Hindi, men are more frequently addressed with honorifics than women. (iii) To examine whether large language models (LLMs) internalize similar socio-pragmatic norms, we probe six LLMs using controlled generation and translation tasks over 1,000 culturally balanced entities. We find that LLMs diverge from Wikipedia usage, exhibiting alternative preferences in honorific selection across tasks, languages, and socio-demographic attributes. These discrepancies highlight gaps in the socio-cultural alignment of LLMs and open new directions for studying how LLMs acquire, adapt, or distort social-linguistic norms.

In practice, however, reconstruction is often implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work, we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12217v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10959v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14401v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs) explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairBatching: Fairness-Aware Batch Formation for LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14392v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental tension between minimizing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency for new requests and maintaining a high, steady token generation rate (low Time-Per-Output-Token, or TPOT) for ongoing requests. Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by Sarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant computational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively, simultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill queuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of service (QoS). This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic nature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid decode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We therefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces fair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an adaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the computational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO violations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the decode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed from bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness. Furthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling more effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and evaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail latency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall 20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in cluster-level capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can MLLMs Absorb Math Reasoning Abilities from LLMs as Free Lunch?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14387v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs), where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However, most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning? Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However, they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance. Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace. IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoreGuard: Safeguarding Foundational Capabilities of LLMs Against Model Stealing in Edge Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13903v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprietary large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and are increasingly deployed on edge devices for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, deploying proprietary LLMs at the edge without adequate protection introduces critical security threats. Attackers can extract model weights and architectures, enabling unauthorized copying and misuse. Even when protective measures prevent full extraction of model weights, attackers may still perform advanced attacks, such as fine-tuning, to further exploit the model. Existing defenses against these threats typically incur significant computational and communication overhead, making them impractical for edge deployment. To safeguard the edge-deployed LLMs, we introduce CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient protection method. CoreGuard employs an efficient protection protocol to reduce computational overhead and minimize communication overhead via a propagation protocol. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves upper-bound security protection with negligible overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[On the Ability of LLMs to Handle Character-Level Perturbations: How Well and How?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14365v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce \nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-, and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and \textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of deploying LLMs across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |

To address dialect-induced performance discrepancies, we introduce AAVENUE ({AAVE} {N}atural Language {U}nderstanding {E}valuation), a benchmark for evaluating large language model (LLM) performance on NLU tasks in AAVE and Standard American English (SAE). AAVENUE builds upon and extends existing benchmarks like VALUE, replacing deterministic syntactic and morphological transformations with a more flexible methodology leveraging LLM-based translation with few-shot prompting, improving performance across our evaluation metrics when translating key tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We compare AAVENUE and VALUE translations using five popular LLMs and a comprehensive set of metrics including fluency, BARTScore, quality, coherence, and understandability. Additionally, we recruit fluent AAVE speakers to validate our translations for authenticity. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently perform better on SAE tasks than AAVE-translated versions, underscoring inherent biases and highlighting the need for more inclusive NLP models. We have open-sourced our source code on GitHub and created a website to showcase our work at https://aavenuee.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NLP4PI @ EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

The security and reliability of these networks are essential, yet depend heavily on accurate modeling of underlying protocols through state machines. While most prior work constructs such models manually from 3GPP specifications, this process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain due to the complexity and frequent updates of the specifications. Recent efforts using natural language processing have shown promise, but remain limited in handling the scale and intricacy of cellular protocols. In this work, we propose SpecGPT, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract protocol state machines from 3GPP documents. SpecGPT segments technical specifications into meaningful paragraphs, applies domain-informed prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning, and employs ensemble methods to enhance output reliability. We evaluate SpecGPT on three representative 5G protocols (NAS, NGAP, and PFCP) using manually annotated ground truth, and show that it outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs for protocol modeling at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Based Bayesian Optimization for Prompt Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04384v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are discussed in detail in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-ERM: Sample-Efficient Program Learning via LLM-Guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a ``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require exponentially many samples on certain short-program families. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs. {\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.</p></details> |  |

What should a local LLM learn from the target language? Which abilities can be transferred from other languages? Do language-specific scaling laws exist? To explore these research questions, we evaluated 35 Japanese, English, and multilingual LLMs on 19 evaluation benchmarks for Japanese and English, taking Japanese as a local language. Adopting an observational approach, we analyzed correlations of benchmark scores, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the scores to derive \textit{ability factors} of local LLMs. We found that training on English text can improve the scores of academic subjects in Japanese (JMMLU). In addition, it is unnecessary to specifically train on Japanese text to enhance abilities for solving Japanese code generation, arithmetic reasoning, commonsense, and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast, training on Japanese text could improve question-answering tasks about Japanese knowledge and English-Japanese translation, which indicates that abilities for solving these two tasks can be regarded as \textit{Japanese abilities} for LLMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Japanese abilities scale with the computational budget for Japanese text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight at the 1st workshop on Multilingual and Equitable Language Technologies (MELT), COLM 2025</p></details> |

Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models (LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG -- demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Most MWP datasets consist of problems containing only the necessary information, while problems with distracting and excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior works have tested popular LLMs and found a dramatic performance drop in the presence of distracting conditions. However, datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions are limited, and most suffer from lower levels of difficulty and out-of-context expressions. This makes distracting conditions easy to identify and exclude, thus reducing the credibility of benchmarking on them. Moreover, when adding distracting conditions, the reasoning and answers may also change, requiring intensive labor to check and write the solutions. To address these issues, we design an iterative framework to generate distracting conditions using LLMs. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from different perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the generation of distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further revision. Another advantage is the shared solutions between original and revised problems: we explicitly guide the LLMs to generate distracting conditions that do not alter the original solutions, thus avoiding the need to generate new solutions. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, reducing the overhead of generating MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining data quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic Self-Learning LLMs in Search Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14253v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

| **[APEX: Empowering LLMs with Physics-Based Task Planning for Real-time Insight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13921v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling. Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source code and experiment setup are publicly available at https://github.com/hwj20/APEX_EXP .</p></details> |  |

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%, improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively, increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations.

In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. In this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs through a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking supports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the token with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step. This behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative reasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information via Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft Thinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy Pitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further demonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration potential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding of continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on improving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, working in progress</p></details> |

Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies, and personalized AI.</p></details> | In Submission |
| **[How Far Have LLMs Come Toward Automated SATD Taxonomy Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. In this study, we investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs) can generate SATD taxonomies. We designed a structured, LLM-driven pipeline that mirrors the taxonomy construction steps researchers typically follow. We evaluated it on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovered domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. It also completed taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than $1, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that, while full automation remains challenging, LLMs can support semi-automated SATD taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automated taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> |  |

Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite.

To address this gap, we formulate the task of selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs, differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[PATCH: Learnable Tile-level Hybrid Sparsity for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23410v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere, preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.</p></details> |  |

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  |

While providing a new dimension for prompt-adaptive safety evaluation, quantifying time-to-unsafe-sampling is challenging: unsafe outputs are often rare in well-aligned models and thus may not be observed under any feasible sampling budget. To address this challenge, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis. We build on recent developments in conformal prediction and propose a novel calibration technique to construct a lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt with rigorous coverage guarantees. Our key technical innovation is an optimized sampling-budget allocation scheme that improves sample efficiency while maintaining distribution-free guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.</p></details> |  |

With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are very few studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper, 6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[One Bug, Hundreds Behind: LLMs for Large-Scale Bug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14036v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments, which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other parts of the program. In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs, BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel. Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice, BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPIN-Bench: How Well Do LLMs Plan Strategically and Reason Socially?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12349v5)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

Most previous works evaluate this through reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success, such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task, and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.</p></details> | EMNLP Main 2025 |

The current design of HPC clusters is inadequate to support this new class however, either incurring long wait times on static batch queues or repeatedly paying expensive LLM startup costs upon resource preemption. To circumvent both the long queues and high startup costs, we propose to "decouple" the LLM initialization context from the actual LLM inferences, and retain the context in GPUs until it is no longer needed, a technique we term "Pervasive Context Management". We transform a fact verification application to enable this technique, allowing it to reduce its execution time by 72.1% (from 3 hours to 48 minutes) using the same amount of GPUs, and scale opportunistically on 32.8% of all GPUs in the cluster and further reduce the execution time to 13 minutes.</p></details> |  |

We argue that ensuring responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local, superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned, verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide agreement.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing prompt injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method that is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal representation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer of the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing features between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we train a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a labeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11 baselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks. The results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we show that PIShield resists strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/weizou52/PIShield</p></details> |

With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.}</p></details> |  |

We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining highly efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/MTI</p></details> |

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment.

Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |

In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities.

However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

Pruning LLMs via Frank-Wolfe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13713v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However, finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to integrality.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks. Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM failures under evolving decode workloads. In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher goodput.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

| **[Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13632v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Public Catalogues: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for ICD Coding of German Tumor Diagnoses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13624v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF)</p></details> |

In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA). Our best submissions ranked 2nd on Task 1, 2nd on Task 3 (API track), and 4th on Task 3 (GPU track).</p></details> |  |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |

Exploring Non-Clinical Induction in LLM Drug-Safety Decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13931v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains, yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner, specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g., low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias: explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a paper accepted as a poster at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Generative AI for Health (GenAI4Health).

| **[Selective Adversarial Attacks on LLM Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13570v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment, develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.</p></details> |  |

This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, they are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These attacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent operates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages , 10 figures</p></details> |
