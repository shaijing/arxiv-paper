| **[Layer-Aware Representation Filtering: Purifying Finetuning Data to Preserve LLM Safety Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18631v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious instructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a \textbf{L}ayer-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{F}iltering method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated.

| **[Explainable Mapper: Charting LLM Embedding Spaces Using Perturbation-Based Explanation and Verification Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18607v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures. Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood (containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AQuilt: Weaving Logic and Self-Inspection into Low-Cost, High-Relevance Data Synthesis for Specialist LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18584v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source code, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |
| **[LingBench++: A Linguistically-Informed Benchmark and Reasoning Framework for Multi-Step and Cross-Cultural Inference with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16809v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++ provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages. We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>42p, ...</summary><p>42p, 17f, 10t.

| **[HARLF: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Lightweight LLM-Driven Sentiment Integration for Financial Portfolio Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18560v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for portfolio optimization, integrating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to combine sentiment signals from financial news with traditional market indicators. Our three-tier architecture employs base RL agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis. Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming equal-weighted and S&P 500 benchmarks. Key contributions include scalable cross-modal integration, a hierarchical RL structure for enhanced stability, and open-source reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Thinker: Scaling Cross-Domain Generalization in LLMs via Multi-Task RL with Hybrid Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14783v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Thinker, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2% over joint training and 9.1% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zeroth-Order Fine-Tuning of LLMs in Random Subspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08989v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/zimingyy/SubZero.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do LLMs Predict Prerequisite Skills? Zero-Shot Comparison to Expert-Defined Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18479v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning, assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts, these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4, Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Embedders for Prior Case Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18455v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR. LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Recent Advancements in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2025) conference</p></details> |
| **[AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinDPO: Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading through Preference Optimization of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18417v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs) have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However, the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO, the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel 'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way, simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).</p></details> |  |
| **[CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Beyond the Obvious: Evaluating Divergent and Convergent Thinking in LLMs for Financial Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18368v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent thinking in LLMs for financial tasks. ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic deployment of LLMs in finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Agentic & GenAI Evaluation KDD2025: KDD workshop on Evaluation and Trustworthiness of Agentic and Generative AI Models https://kdd-eval-workshop.github.io/genai-evaluation-kdd2025/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Uncertainty in LLMs through Evidential Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18366v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However, such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling, involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via evidential learning. Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Profile: From Surface-Level Facts to Deep Persona Simulation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12988v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses. However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought patterns as manifested in the textual works of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLMs while considering the importance of ethical standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Annotation for Propaganda Detection: Integrating LLM Pre-Annotations with Human Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18343v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM) assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation. Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.</p></details> | NLP4PI at ACL |
| **[TDR: Task-Decoupled Retrieval with Fine-Grained LLM Feedback for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18340v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2) Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at https://github.com/Nnn-s/TDR.</p></details> |  |

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG.

| **[OR-LLM-Agent: Automating Modeling and Solving of Operations Research Optimization Problems with Reasoning LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10009v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), applying large language models (LLMs) to Operations Research (OR) problem-solving has attracted increasing attention. Most existing approaches attempt to improve OR problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The agent decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, a high-quality dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that existing benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR suffer from certain issues, making them less suitable for reliably evaluating LLM performance. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ORLM, by at least 7% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |

However, research on the domain generalizability of deep learning models for vision-language tasks remains limited, primarily because of the lack of required datasets. To address these challenges, we propose VolDoGer: Vision-Language Dataset for Domain Generalization, a dedicated dataset designed for domain generalization that addresses three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. We constructed VolDoGer by extending LLM-based data annotation techniques to vision-language tasks, thereby alleviating the burden of recruiting human annotators. We evaluated the domain generalizability of various models, ranging from fine-tuned models to a recent multimodal large language model, through VolDoGer.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Workshop on Curated Data for Efficient Learning (CDEL)</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability, and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and educational analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Security Based on LLM Approaches: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18215v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in information security, systematically review its application progress in malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and accurate information security protection system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune&Comp: Free Lunch for Layer-Pruned LLMs via Iterative Pruning with Magnitude Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18212v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred. We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop, Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance, when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by 4.01%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Transformation from Natural Language to Signal Temporal Logic Using LLMs with Diverse External Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20658v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL 2025</p></details> |

However, this process may increase the model's dependence on user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore, we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Accepted</p></details> |

However, the high decoding latency of LLMs challenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has been explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key characteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce the real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative decoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed based on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which results in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given output mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features an adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the draft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further proposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously generated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a two-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the latency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the baseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively, without any loss in recognition accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Runtime Verification for LLMs via Robustness Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17723v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial robustness verification is essential for ensuring the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in runtime-critical applications. However, formal verification techniques remain computationally infeasible for modern LLMs due to their exponential runtime and white-box access requirements. This paper presents a case study adapting and extending the RoMA statistical verification framework to assess its feasibility as an online runtime robustness monitor for LLMs in black-box deployment settings. Our adaptation of RoMA analyzes confidence score distributions under semantic perturbations to provide quantitative robustness assessments with statistically validated bounds. Our empirical validation against formal verification baselines demonstrates that RoMA achieves comparable accuracy (within 1\% deviation), and reduces verification times from hours to minutes. We evaluate this framework across semantic, categorial, and orthographic perturbation domains. Our results demonstrate RoMA's effectiveness for robustness monitoring in operational LLM deployments. These findings point to RoMA as a potentially scalable alternative when formal methods are infeasible, with promising implications for runtime verification in LLM-based systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis, analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further exploration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue, they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this paper systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics (LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper URL: https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1576/; Presentation Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j63ooKE50I0</p></details> |

Ultra low-bit quantization can significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression (i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs' weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2 show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods. Our code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

These findings motivate research efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects. This paper introduces a causal formulation for bias measurement in generative language models. Based on this theoretical foundation, we outline a list of desiderata for designing robust bias benchmarks. We then propose a benchmark called OccuGender, with a bias-measuring procedure to investigate occupational gender bias. We test several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs on OccuGender, including Llama, Mistral, and their instruction-tuned versions. The results show that these models exhibit substantial occupational gender bias. Lastly, we discuss prompting strategies for bias mitigation and an extension of our causal formulation to illustrate the generalizability of our framework.

While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e., linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e., re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving reviewer privacy.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder. We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and generalization across vision-language domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Traditional approaches to inference serving often struggle with resource inefficiencies, leading to high operational costs, latency issues, and limited scalability.

By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations using Kubernetes-based autoscaling, we show that Cloud Native architectures can dynamically adapt to workload fluctuations, mitigating performance bottlenecks while optimizing LLM inference serving performance. This discussion provides a broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of efficient LLM serving. To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and workloads.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Analyzing Islamophobic Discourse Using Semi-Coded Terms and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18273v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Islamophobia has gained significant traction across Western societies, fueled by the rise of digital communication networks. This paper performs a large-scale analysis of specialized, semi-coded Islamophobic terms such as (muzrat, pislam, mudslime, mohammedan, muzzies) floated on extremist social platforms, i.e., 4Chan, Gab, Telegram, etc. Many of these terms appear lexically neutral or ambiguous outside of specific contexts, making them difficult for both human moderators and automated systems to reliably identify as hate speech. First, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to show their ability to understand these terms. Second, Google Perspective API suggests that Islamophobic posts tend to receive higher toxicity scores than other categories of hate speech like Antisemitism. Finally, we use BERT topic modeling approach to extract different topics and Islamophobic discourse on these social platforms. Our findings indicate that LLMs understand these Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) slurs; however, further improvements in moderation strategies and algorithmic detection are necessary to address such discourse effectively. Our topic modeling also indicates that Islamophobic text is found across various political, conspiratorial, and far-right movements and is particularly directed against Muslim immigrants. Taken altogether, we performed one of the first studies on Islamophobic semi-coded terms and shed a global light on Islamophobia.</p></details> |  |

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose TimelyHLS, a novel framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically generate and iteratively refine HLS code optimized for FPGA-specific timing and performance requirements. TimelyHLS is driven by a structured architectural knowledge base containing FPGA-specific features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates. Given a kernel, TimelyHLS generates HLS code annotated with both timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. The synthesized RTL is then evaluated using commercial toolchains, and simulation correctness is verified against reference outputs via custom testbenches. TimelyHLS iteratively incorporates synthesis logs and performance reports into the LLM engine for refinement in the presence of functional discrepancies. Experimental results across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks show that TimelyHLS reduces the need for manual tuning by up to 70%, while achieving up to 4x latency speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort) and over 50% area savings in certain cases (e.g., 57% FF reduction in Viterbi). TimelyHLS consistently achieves timing closure and functional correctness across platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-driven, architecture-aware synthesis in automating FPGA design.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.</p></details> |  |

To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC. We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These results have important implications for our understanding and governance of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ICML 2025 Workshop on Assessing World Models</p></details> |

Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation.

| **[Chemical reasoning in LLMs unlocks strategy-aware synthesis planning and reaction mechanism elucidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08537v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While automated chemical tools excel at specific tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful tools enabling chemical analysis. When integrated with traditional search algorithms, they enable a new approach to computer-aided synthesis that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our system allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language -- from protecting group strategies to global feasibility assessment -- and uses traditional or LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to find routes that satisfy these constraints. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. This approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with newer and larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical automation systems.</p></details> |  |

This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing computational resources for other users. We conducted a statistical analysis and simulation based on a statistical model derived from data collected in a crowdsourced user study across various types of LLM-generated content. Our results show that this adaptive method can effectively reduce computational consumption while largely maintaining streaming speed above user's normal reading speed.</p></details> |  |

This work presents an edge-centric framework that integrates LLMs into IoT architectures to enable natural language-based control, context-aware decision-making, and enhanced automation. The proposed modular and lightweight Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLMs are deployed on edge computing devices connected to IoT gateways, enabling local processing of user commands and sensor data for reduced latency, improved privacy, and enhanced inference quality. We validate the framework through a smart home prototype using LLaMA 3 and Gemma 2B models for controlling smart devices. Experimental results highlight the trade-offs between model accuracy and inference time with respect to models size. At last, we also discuss the potential applications that can use LLM-based IoT systems, and a few key challenges associated with such systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.20970</p></details> |

Prior work has explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |

However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> |  |

This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon Vague Perception. And thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of Unknown responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation can convert them into either correct Known or correct Unknown with valid reasoning. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the potential reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the Vague Perception phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers, the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of 87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off relative to our original early-stopping method.</p></details> |  |

Current algorithmic approaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often failing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large language models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies across various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core research proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity evaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two datasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains, focusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional proxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the efficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that even the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the performance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the incorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human perspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a Pearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\% when compared to the results of the user study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate and cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity evaluation in recommender systems.</p></details> | RecSys2025 |

Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors. This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TwiUSD, the first large-scale, manually annotated UserSD benchmark with explicit followee relationships, containing 16,211 users and 47,757 tweets. TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.</p></details> |  |

Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems, and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages: First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks, spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and 3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs.</p></details> | COLM2025 |

A Study on Automatic Generation of GitHub Actions Configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17165v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions, require developers to write YAML-based configurations, which can be tedious and error-prone. Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI configurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study evaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural language descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models (GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code Llama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind, constructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with corresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves up to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches. Code-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones in YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration generation. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed steps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect structural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation quality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our research offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration languages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a \textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation. Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Multi-Agent Negotiation for Medical Supply Chains:Integrating LLMs and Blockchain for Transparent Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17134v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figure |
| **[BrownoutServe: SLO-Aware Inference Serving under Bursty Workloads for MoE-based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17133v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely applied to large language models (LLMs), providing a promising solution that activates only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, thereby reducing overall memory requirements and allowing for faster inference compared to dense models. Despite these advantages, existing systems still face issues of low efficiency due to static model placement and lack of dynamic workloads adaptation. This leads to suboptimal resource utilization and increased latency, especially during bursty requests periods. To address these challenges, this paper introduces BrownoutServe, a novel serving framework designed to optimize inference efficiency and maintain service reliability for MoE-based LLMs under dynamic computational demands and traffic conditions. BrownoutServe introduces "united experts" that integrate knowledge from multiple experts, reducing the times of expert access and inference latency. Additionally, it proposes a dynamic brownout mechanism to adaptively adjust the processing of certain tokens, optimizing inference performance while guaranteeing service level objectives (SLOs) are met. Our evaluations show the effectiveness of BrownoutServe under various workloads: it achieves up to 2.07x throughput improvement compared to vLLM and reduces SLO violations by 90.28%, showcasing its robustness under bursty traffic while maintaining acceptable inference accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |

To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

By synthesizing evidence from both text and image modalities and incorporating agent-based refinement, CRAVE ensures consistency and diversity in evidence representation.

Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks.

This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by 117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 tables, Appendix A-K</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as a code generator in Agile Model Driven Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18489v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tournament of Prompts: Evolving LLM Instructions Through Structured Debates and Elo Ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00178v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings. (1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages with 9 pictures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Never Come Up Empty: Adaptive HyDE Retrieval for Improving LLM Developer Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16754v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with code-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable answers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However, designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically, we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding (HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG pipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot performance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These findings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer quality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen and novel questions across different LLMs</p></details> |  |
