| **[RepreGuard: Detecting LLM-Generated Text by Revealing Hidden Representation Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13152v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

| **[OptimalThinkingBench: Evaluating Over and Underthinking in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13141v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench, featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11 challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other, highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spot the BlindSpots: Systematic Identification and Quantification of Fine-Grained LLM Biases in Contact Center Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13124v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript, potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic) for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT, Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.</p></details> |  |
| **[VerilogLAVD: LLM-Aided Rule Generation for Vulnerability Detection in Verilog](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13092v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data. In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types, VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Are In-Context Bandit Reinforcement Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05362v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Matrix-Driven Instant Review: Confident Detection and Reconstruction of LLM Plagiarism on PC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at the same directory as the TeX source.

| **[From Templates to Natural Language: Generalization Challenges in Instruction-Tuned LLMs for Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14425v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on a variety of tasks; however, generalizing from synthetic to human-authored instructions in grounded environments remains a challenge for them. In this work, we study generalization challenges in spatial grounding tasks where models interpret and translate instructions for building object arrangements on a $2.5$D grid. We fine-tune LLMs using only synthetic instructions and evaluate their performance on a benchmark dataset containing both synthetic and human-written instructions. Our results reveal that while models generalize well on simple tasks, their performance degrades significantly on more complex tasks. We present a detailed error analysis of the gaps in instruction generalization.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12935v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users' emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and response quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM Agent-Based Complex Semantic Table Annotation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12868v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications. However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms, spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70% reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overconfidence in LLM-as-a-Judge: Diagnosis and Confidence-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06225v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Human and LLM Judgments: Understanding and Narrowing the Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12792v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Ethical Alignment: Evaluating LLMs as Artificial Moral Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12754v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning. In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper published in ECAI 2025 proceedings (IOS Press, CC BY-NC 4.0)</p></details> |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedSODA: Federated Fine-tuning of LLMs via Similarity Group Pruning and Orchestrated Distillation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12727v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment (ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book), containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus, and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-4B models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Multi-Agent LLMs with Interpretable Physics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in physics research by assisting with symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, and scientific reasoning. However, ensuring the reliability, transparency, and interpretability of their outputs remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent LLM physicist framework that fosters collaboration between AI and human scientists through three key modules: a reasoning module, an interpretation module, and an AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands logical rigor, quantitative accuracy, and alignment with established theoretical models, we propose an interpretation module that employs a team of specialized LLM agents-including summarizers, model builders, visualization tools, and testers-to systematically structure LLM outputs into transparent, physically grounded science models. A case study demonstrates that our approach significantly improves interpretability, enables systematic validation, and enhances human-AI collaboration in physics problem-solving and discovery. Our work bridges free-form LLM reasoning with interpretable, executable models for scientific analysis, enabling more transparent and verifiable AI-augmented research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on MAS</p></details> |
| **[Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Induced Linguistic Fingerprints for LLM-Generated Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12632v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction (LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LIFE-E86A.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond GPT-5: Making LLMs Cheaper and Better via Performance-Efficiency Optimized Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12631v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing, dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach ~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost, and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/AvengersPro.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[An LLM + ASP Workflow for Joint Entity-Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12611v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a 2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, Accepted as Technical Communication, 41st International Conference on Logic Programming</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Forward-Only Data Valuation for Pretrained LLMs and VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10180v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting mislabeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAV Individual Identification via Distilled RF Fingerprints-Based LLM in ISAC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12597v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) individual (ID) identification is a critical security surveillance strategy in low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled wireless radio frequency fingerprint large language model (RFF-LLM) framework for UAV ID identification. First, we propose an RFF-LLM framework based on the modified GPT-2 model to improve the identification accuracy in complex outdoor environments. Then, considering the parameter overhead of the RFF-LLM, we design a dynamic KD strategy to compress the model. Specifically, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to dynamically adjust the distillation temperature, overcoming the local optimum dilemma inherent in static KD. As a next step, the knowledge of the RFF-LLM is adequately transferred to the lightweight Lite-HRNet model. Finally, our experiments are conducted based on the self-built drone RFF dataset of Release one, namely DRFF-R1, by collecting the I/Q signals of 20 commercial UAVs in channel 149. The experiment results show that the proposed framework achieves 98.38\% ID identification accuracy with merely 0.15 million parameters and 2.74 ms response time, which outperforms the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecDetect: Simple, Fast, and Training-Free Detection of LLM-Generated Text via Spectral Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11343v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs) demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Energy-Efficient Wireless LLM Inference via Uncertainty and Importance-Aware Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12590v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged, combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens, reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by 40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an energy-efficient and accurate deployment of LLMs in bandwidth-constrained edge environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

The crucial step in this field is to apply advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance. Consequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences obtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs in enhancing the accuracy of amyloid prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Illuminating LLM Coding Agents: Visual Analytics for Deeper Understanding and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12555v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g., LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1) Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis, which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides valuable insights into the iterative coding process.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.</p></details> | 27 pages, 32 figures |
| **[Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624v6)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aclanthology.org/2025.gem-1.33/</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1% improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only 4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 tables |

Cryptographic reasoning offers an ideal RL testbed: it combines precise validation, structured multi-step inference, and reliance on reliable computational tool use. Leveraging these properties, we fine-tune a Python tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in a secure execution environment. The resulting agent achieves a significant improvement in Pass@8 on previously unseen challenges. Moreover, the improvements generalize to two external benchmarks: 'picoCTF', spanning both crypto and non-crypto tasks, and 'AICrypto MCQ', a multiple-choice benchmark of 135 cryptography questions. Ablation studies attribute the gains to enhanced tool usage and procedural reasoning. These findings position 'Random-Crypto' as a rich training ground for building intelligent, adaptable LLM agents capable of handling complex cybersecurity tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Cost-Aware Contrastive Routing for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12491v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection. CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency. Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> |  |

Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model (LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted neuromuscular assessment and athlete monitoring platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Bandit Based Optimal LLM Selection for a Pipeline of Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09958v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17771v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (\textsc{2SSP}) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron on the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test \textsc{2SSP} on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time.

However, it remains challenging due to the multifaceted evaluation criteria involved, such as creativity and peer-comparative achievement. Meanwhile, instructors often struggle to maintain fairness throughout the time-consuming grading process. Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality. However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an instructor's educational insights into the class situation. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI collaborative grading systems.</p></details> |  |

Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers. To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii) benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection. Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used. Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110 lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B, Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models (GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen = 66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between synthetic and real speech. Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in multimodal modeling.</p></details> |  |

We present a structured approach for automated novelty evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning. Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and 75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise.

This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks, categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by 20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30% for out-toolset tasks.

Leading examples like OpenAI's Deep Research highlight their potential for deep information mining and real-world applications. This survey provides the first systematic analysis of search agents.

Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph with post-training alignment with synthetic data. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that post-training alignment would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting on synthetic data. We employ post-training alignment algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our post-training alignment recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards on synthetic data but not on real-world tasks, and compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after post-training alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables.

However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$ employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity. Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Self-Execution Benchmark: Measuring LLMs' Attempts to Overcome Their Lack of Self-Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12277v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on tasks that test their knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs represent and reason about their own behavior.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding LLM-Centric Challenges for Deep Learning Frameworks: An Empirical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13114v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress across a wide range of real-world applications. Realizing such models requires substantial system-level support. Deep learning (DL) frameworks provide this foundation by enabling efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment. The large parameter scale and extended execution cycles impose exacting demands on deep learning frameworks, particularly in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency. Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste. However, a fundamental question has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies, i.e., what challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? To answer this question, we analyze issue reports from three major DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits such as Megatron. Based on a manual review of these reports, we construct a taxonomy that captures LLM-centric framework bugs, user requirements, and user questions. We then refine and enrich this taxonomy through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers. Based on the constructed taxonomy and findings summarized from interviews, our study further reveals key technical challenges and mismatches between LLM user needs and developer priorities.</p></details> | 46 pages, 14 figures |

However, effective reasoning in real-world tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem, ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[StepTool: Enhancing Multi-Step Tool Usage in LLMs via Step-Grained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07745v4)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their powerful text generation capabilities, large language models (LLMs) still struggle to effectively utilize external tools to solve complex tasks, a challenge known as tool learning. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning, treating tool learning as a text generation problem while overlooking the decision-making complexities inherent in multi-step contexts. In this work, we propose modeling tool learning as a dynamic decision-making process and introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' capabilities in multi-step tool use. StepTool comprises two key components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards to each tool interaction based on its invocation success and contribution to task completion; and Step-grained Optimization, which applies policy gradient methods to optimize the model across multiple decision steps. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that StepTool consistently outperforms both SFT-based and RL-based baselines in terms of task Pass Rate and Recall of relevant tools. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that StepTool helps models discover new tool-use strategies rather than merely re-weighting prior knowledge. These results highlight the importance of fine-grained decision modeling in tool learning and establish StepTool as a general and robust solution for enhancing multi-step tool use in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/yuyq18/StepTool.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM'25 |
| **[LD-Scene: LLM-Guided Diffusion for Controllable Generation of Adversarial Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11247v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems necessitates a comprehensive evaluation in safety-critical scenarios. However, these safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions, facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over adversarial behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective testing tailored to specific driving scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LinkAnchor: An Autonomous LLM-Based Agent for Issue-to-Commit Link Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12232v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software traceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19855v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures, |

Within this process, document reranking plays a critical role in refining first-stage retrieval results. However, standard LLM listwise reranking faces challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower. Meanwhile, conventional listwise reranking places the full text of candidates into the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking, constraining overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we explore semantic-feature-based compact document representations (e.g., categories, sections, and keywords) and propose CoRank, a training-free, model-agnostic reranking framework for scientific retrieval. It presents a three-stage solution: (i) offline extraction of document features, (ii) coarse-grained reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained reranking on full texts of the top candidates from (ii). This integrated process addresses suboptimal first-stage retrieval: Compact representations allow more documents to fit within the context window, improving candidate set coverage, while the final fine-grained ranking ensures a more accurate ordering. Experiments on 5 academic retrieval datasets show that CoRank significantly improves reranking performance across different LLM backbones (average nDCG@10 from 50.6 to 55.5). Overall, these results underscore the synergistic interaction between information extraction and information retrieval, demonstrating how structured semantic features can enhance reranking in the scientific domain.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v5)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |

Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home</p></details> |

Exploring the Alignment of Human and LLM Perceptions of Privacy in Textual Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12158v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$ paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators. Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically, exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with innovative technical solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI 2026 |

Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g., choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g., attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective neural tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions, Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks, thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly, our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords. Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, limited communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.</p></details> |  |

Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The initial versin was made in August 2024</p></details> |

Existing CRE methods mainly use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (final version)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR, covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2) entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization, examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages,25figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2508.02260</p></details> |

Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 51 pages</p></details> |

However, most research focuses on improving the output quality of LLMs (e.g., correctness), and less attention has been paid to the LLM input (e.g., the training code quality). Given that code smells are widely existed in practice and can negatively impact software maintainability and readability, this study takes the first systematic research to assess and improve dataset quality in terms of code smells. In this work, we first conduct a preliminary study to explore the presence of code smells in a popular benchmark dataset (i.e., CodeSearchNet-Python}) and evaluate the output of several popular LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagiCoder), revealing that code smell issues extensively exist in LLM's input (e.g., benchmark dataset) and output (e.g., generated code). We then conduct our systematic research by taking three main steps: Firstly, we propose an LLM-based code smell cleaning tool, named SmellCC, which automatically refactors and removes code smells. To evaluate the correctness of the code refactoring, we construct a test set of 50 repositories sourced from the CodeSearchNet-Python benchmark for functional testing. Then we apply our curated smell-cleaned dataset to fine-tune two LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen-Coder) to explore their potential for generating high-quality code. Thirdly, we investigate the impact of code smells on two downstream tasks: code completion and code search. Lastly, we derive several actionable implications for software engineering researchers and industry practitioners from our findings.</p></details> |  |

While most existing studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics. We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games. Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future research and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on the perfect aspect in these languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset (1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we present the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative, and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems.

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[STORM: Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04130v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

At the document level, we leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of scientific text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Text ...</summary><p>Text Simplification, hallucination detection, LLMs, CLEF 2025, SimpleText, CEUR-WS</p></details> |

Between a literature digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external (comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs in constructing peer reviews.</p></details> |  |

Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-DPO: A Dual-Perspective Paradigm for Dynamic Preference Learning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10054v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.</p></details> |  |

We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil.

Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as a robust, efficient, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems.

While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python, each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10 computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account, surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental, causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of 12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reference Points in LLM Sentiment Analysis: The Role of Structured Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11454v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.</p></details> |  |

Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11425v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.</p></details> | Under Review |

Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in implicit downstream task behavior.</p></details> | 7 pages 1 figure |

While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability.

While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI Social Impact 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of 5 methods for improving prompt robustness within a unified experimental framework. We benchmark these techniques on 8 models from Llama, Qwen and Gemma families across 52 tasks from Natural Instructions dataset. Our evaluation covers robustness methods from both fine-tuned and in-context learning paradigms, and tests their generalization against multiple types of distribution shifts. Finally, we extend our analysis to GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 to assess frontier models' current robustness to format perturbations. Our findings offer actionable insights into the relative effectiveness of these robustness methods, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions when aiming for stable and reliable LLM performance in real-world applications.

However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we apply 4-bit Group Scaling Quantization (GSQ) and Generative Pretrained Transformer Quantization (GPTQ) to LLaMA 1B, Qwen 0.5B, and PHI 1.5B, evaluating their impact across multiple NLP tasks. We benchmark these models on MS MARCO (Information Retrieval), BoolQ (Boolean Question Answering), and GSM8K (Mathematical Reasoning) datasets, assessing both accuracy and efficiency across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable decisions based on the specifications that need to be met.

However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query from Different Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLMs, but overlooked the diversity of queriers. In this work, we propose a new form of querier-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different queriers. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-querier general encoder and a querier-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same querier, while pulling apart those of different queriers. To mitigate the impact of query diversity on querier-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on query similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. To address the lack of datasets designed for querier-aware personalization, we also build a multi-querier dataset from English and Chinese scripts, as well as WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 queriers and 12 responders. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design significantly improves the quality of personalized response generation, achieving relative improvement of 8.4% to 48.7% in ROUGE-L scores and winning rates ranging from 54% to 82% compared with various baseline methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM'25 |
| **[Dynamic Quality-Latency Aware Routing for LLM Inference in Wireless Edge-Device Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11291v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE/CIC ICCC workshop</p></details> |
| **[SafeConstellations: Steering LLM Safety to Reduce Over-Refusals Through Task-Specific Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11290v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Inference performance evaluation for LLMs on edge devices with a novel benchmarking framework and metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11269v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the significant success achieved by large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, edge computing-based LLM inference services for mobile and PC are in high demand for data privacy. However, different edge platforms have different hardware characteristics and the large demand for memory capacity and bandwidth makes it very challenging to deploy and benchmark LLMs on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference benchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge platforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of the theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific model running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on three edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU in combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and accuracy. And we analyze the results to derive the key factors, constraints, unpredictability in optimizing MBU that can guide deploying LLMs on more edge platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNVEILING: What Makes Linguistics Olympiad Puzzles Tricky for LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11260v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Group Fairness Meets the Black Box: Enabling Fair Algorithms on Closed LLMs via Post-Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11258v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination in LLM-Based Code Generation: An Automotive Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11257v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10450v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.
