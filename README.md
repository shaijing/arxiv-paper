| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14285v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference standard paper</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLM-Assisted Blue Teaming via Standardized Threat Hunting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23571v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Vulnerabilities of LLM-Assisted Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23573v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Ethically Grounded LLM-Based Approach to Insider Threat Synthesis and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06920v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1, specificity, FAR, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Ambiguity in LLMs is a concept missing problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, title updated</p></details> |
| **[LLM Watermark Evasion via Bias Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23019v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMisalignment: Measuring the Propensity for Misaligned Behaviour in LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04018v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepi...</summary><p>Prepint, under review for NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-guided Task and Motion Planning using Knowledge-based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07493v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments requires efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches that combine high-level symbolic plans with low-level motion control. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to knowledge based systems</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLMs for Combinatorial Optimization: One-Phase and Two-Phase Heuristics for 2D Bin-Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22255v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in combinatorial optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 tab...</summary><p>1 table, 6 figures. 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Accepted for the Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |
| **[Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25448v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. While GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: first, the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; second, GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the assumption that no weights are clipped. Leveraging this bound, we design post-training quantization methods that avoid clipping, and outperform the original GPTQ. In addition, we provide efficient GPU inference kernels for the resulting representation. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on a firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-ARGUE: LLM-Based Report Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26184v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation. We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECIR ...</summary><p>ECIR 2025 demo format</p></details> |
| **[AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Drawing on the Argumentative Theory of Reasoning, we argue that confirmation bias, often seen as detrimental, can be harnessed as a resource when paired with critical evaluation. We propose a three-step process in which individuals first generate ideas independently, then use LLMs to refine and articulate them, and finally engage with LLMs as epistemic provocateurs to anticipate group critique. This framing positions LLMs as tools for scaffolding disagreement, helping individuals prepare for more productive group discussions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition of LLMs via Progressive Vocabulary Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12310v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the critical need for democratizing large language models (LLM) in the Arab world, a region that has seen slower progress in developing models comparable to state-of-the-art offerings like GPT-4 or ChatGPT 3.5, due to a predominant focus on mainstream languages (e.g., English and Chinese). One practical objective for an Arabic LLM is to utilize an Arabic-specific vocabulary for the tokenizer that could speed up decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to a degradation of learned knowledge since many words are initially out-of-vocabulary (OOV) when training starts. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion. Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks. Models, training data, benchmarks, and codes will be all open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Predictive and Synergistic Two-Layer Scheduling Framework for LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23384v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM inference serving typically scales out with a two-tier architecture: a cluster router distributes requests to multiple inference engines, each of which then in turn performs its own internal scheduling. However, this commonly used paradigm suffers from critical, systemic inefficiency caused by the information gaps across two layers. At the cluster-layer, the router mainly relies on lagging, coarse-grained metrics, such as average latency and queue length to make decisions, resulting in "decision lag" that leads to suboptimal request routing. At the engine-layer, static heuristic scheduling policies cannot effectively handle the dynamic workloads, leading a poor balance between latency and throughput. Besides, these gaps may cause SLO violations and resource waste, especially in heterogeneous cloud environments. To bridge such gaps, we propose NexusSched, a cross-layer framework that shifts LLM serving system from reactive load balancing to predictive orchestration. The core of NexusSched lies in a structurally-informed online performance model that provides accurate, forward-looking per-step latency and capacity estimations. This model empowers two key components. At the engine-layer, LENS performs SLO-aware, adaptive scheduling, dynamically optimizing batching to meet SLOs under real-time loads. At the cluster-layer, PRISM uses predictive signals to perform state-driven routing, maximizing cluster-wide performance and SLO attainment. Performance evaluations show that NexusSched improves SLO attainment by 43% on average and achieves up to 3x throughput speedup in long-context and heterogeneous scenarios. Besides, we also deploy NexusSched on FlowGPT's clusters to demonstrate its advantages in production environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update the system name in the summary</p></details> |
| **[On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases Written in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19136v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Scaffolding: Distilling the Flow of Thought from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23619v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition) that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency, providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners, not just fluent mimics.</p></details> |  |
| **[From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18980v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |
| **[NL2Plan: Robust LLM-Driven Planning from Minimal Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04215v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical planners are powerful systems, but modeling tasks in input formats such as PDDL is tedious and error-prone. In contrast, planning with Large Language Models (LLMs) allows for almost any input text, but offers no guarantees on plan quality or even soundness. In an attempt to merge the best of these two approaches, some work has begun to use LLMs to automate parts of the PDDL creation process. However, these methods still require various degrees of expert input or domain-specific adaptations. We present NL2Plan, the first fully automatic system for generating complete PDDL tasks from minimal natural language descriptions. NL2Plan uses an LLM to incrementally extract the necessary information from the short text input before creating a complete PDDL description of both the domain and the problem which is finally solved by a classical planner. We evaluate NL2Plan on seven planning domains, five of which are novel and thus not in the LLM training data, and find that NL2Plan outperforms directly generating the files with an LLM+validator combination. As such, NL2Plan is a powerful tool for assistive PDDL modeling and a step towards solving natural language planning task with interpretability and guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the ICAPS 2024 Workshop on Human-Aware and Explainable Planning</p></details> |
| **[iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Framework for LLM Evaluation with Answer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20097v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | 16pages |

However, we observe that dialogue diversity tends to degrade over long-term simulations. To explore the role of prompt design in this phenomenon, we modularized the utterance generation prompt and found that reducing contextual information leads to more diverse outputs. Based on this insight, we propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that allows users to control diversity via a single parameter, lambda. APP dynamically prunes prompt segments based on attention scores and is compatible with existing diversity control methods. We demonstrate that APP effectively modulates diversity through extensive experiments and propose a method to balance the control trade-offs. Our analysis reveals that all prompt components impose constraints on diversity, with the Memory being the most influential. Additionally, high-attention contents consistently suppress output diversity.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Training-free LLM Verification via Recycling Few-shot Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17251v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (ReFeri). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, ReFeri evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference. Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting, but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500. Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades. Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Latent Collective Preference Optimization: A General Framework for Robust LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Latent Collective Preference Optimization (LCPO). LCPO leverages an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the latent collective consensus from noisy data. It operates by inferring the correctness of each preference label and using this probability as an adaptive weight to re-calibrate each data point's contribution to the training loss, thereby mitigating noise. We generalize this approach by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their corresponding probabilistic models, elevating LCPO from a specific algorithm to a general framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a perfectly calibrated model, LCPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate LCPO's effectiveness as a general framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the LCPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% on both benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address limited image-text paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation. mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology. Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |

However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Interactive Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26306v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be released later</p></details> |

Investigating Identity Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Travel Planning Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17333v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discerning What Matters: A Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Moral Competence in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13082v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning, not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however, substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs' abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[$p$-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23234v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.</p></details> |  |

Many focus on problems with fixed ground-truth answers, and are often saturated due to problem simplicity or the viability of guessing or memorization. Crucially, they capture only a narrow subset of relevant math problems. To address this research gap, we introduce MathConstruct, a new benchmark of 121 challenging problems sourced from various math competitions, which targets constructive proofs, a widely encountered problem type requiring the construction of mathematical objects with specific properties. These proofs are particularly suitable for LLM evaluation, as solution correctness can be easily verified. Our automated verifiers also enable MathConstruct to generate problem variations, used to evaluate robustness. State-of-the-art LLMs solve only 60% of MathConstruct problems, highlighting its complexity and importance for LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically investigates how five state-of-the-art LLMs -- Claude, DeepSeek, GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral - conceptualize sustainability and its relationship with AI. We administered validated, psychometric sustainability-related questionnaires - each 100 times per model -- to capture response patterns and variability. Our findings revealed significant inter-model differences: For example, GPT exhibited skepticism about the compatibility of AI and sustainability, whereas LLaMA demonstrated extreme techno-optimism with perfect scores for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Models also diverged in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability integration, a results that holds implications for technology governance approaches. Our results demonstrate that model selection could substantially influence organizational sustainability strategies, highlighting the need for awareness of model-specific biases when deploying LLMs for sustainability-related decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for EMNLP Conference</p></details> |

While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However, transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods. Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the communication overhead further while providing richer representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead by approximately 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Globecom 2025</p></details> |

We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV) and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Language Mixing on Bilingual LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15849v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing-alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://junlinhan.github.io/projects/lsbs/</p></details> |

While these generated test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed self bias.</p></details> |  |

However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical. Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations. Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts. Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd Workshop on Regulatable ML at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26578v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome. Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling, the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison. Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.</p></details> |  |

However, most prior LLM-based work in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs within fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in exploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks of varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios involving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs to determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions significantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains generalizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline methods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26553v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models gain access to external tools via structured function calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Verified Code Reasoning by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26546v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature). As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps. We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications.

| **[Robust LLM Training Infrastructure at ByteDance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16293v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable LLM Math Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCogent: Mitigating LLMs' Working Memory Constraints via Multi-Agent Collaboration in Complex Graph Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12379v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries. This phenomenon arises from LLMs' working memory constraints, which result in their inability to retain long-range graph topology over extended contexts while sustaining coherent multi-step reasoning. However, real-world graphs are often structurally complex, such as Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation networks. To address these limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and tool creation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark that contains four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks, categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales up to 10 times larger than existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by 20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30% for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.</p></details> |  |

However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ShaoShuai0605/Misevolution .

Yet these scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers, transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that restrict accessibility to only highly technical users. We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and (ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes. Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by (i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii) prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables. We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses, illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in clinical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to GenAI4Health@NeurIPS 2025.

But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast-dLLM v2: Efficient Block-Diffusion LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Next Token Probabilities: Learnable, Fast Detection of Hallucinations and Data Contamination on LLM Output Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14043v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automated detection of hallucinations and training data contamination is pivotal to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). These tasks are particularly challenging in settings where no access to model internals is available. Current approaches in this setup typically leverage only the probabilities of actual tokens in the text, relying on simple task-specific heuristics. Crucially, they overlook the information contained in the full sequence of next-token probability distributions. We propose to go beyond hand-crafted decision rules by learning directly from the complete observable output of LLMs -- consisting not only of next-token probabilities, but also the full sequence of next-token distributions. We refer to this as the LLM Output Signature (LOS), and treat it as a reference data type for detecting hallucinations and data contamination. To that end, we introduce LOS-Net, a lightweight attention-based architecture trained on an efficient encoding of the LOS, which can provably approximate a broad class of existing techniques for both tasks. Empirically, LOS-Net achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, while maintaining extremely low detection latency. Furthermore, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs. Full code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/Beyond-next-token-probabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlimPack: Fine-Grained Asymmetric Packing for Balanced and Efficient Variable-Length LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26246v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or communication efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high resource efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted submission to the AI4MAT workshop@NEURIPS 2025.

The system comprises specialized RAN (energy efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases -- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i) semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii) diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies, either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines, respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving latency and energy saving distributions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

We explore as a case study Venice's urban history during the critical period from 1740 to 1808, capturing the transition following the fall of the ancient Republic and the Ancien R\'egime. This era's complex cadastral data, marked by its volume and lack of uniform structure, presents unique challenges that our approach adeptly navigates, enabling us to generate spatial queries that bridge past and present urban landscapes. We present a text-to-programs framework that leverages Large Language Models (\llms) to process natural language queries as executable code for analyzing historical cadastral records. Our methodology implements two complementary techniques: a SQL agent for handling structured queries about specific cadastral information, and a coding agent for complex analytical operations requiring custom data manipulation. We propose a taxonomy that classifies historical research questions based on their complexity and analytical requirements, mapping them to the most appropriate technical approach. This framework is supported by an investigation into the execution consistency of the system, alongside a qualitative analysis of the answers it produces. By ensuring interpretability and minimizing hallucination through verifiable program outputs, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in reconstructing past population information, property features, and spatiotemporal comparisons in Venice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Cambridge press - Computational Humanities Research 2025</p></details> |

As LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Parallax: Efficient LLM Inference Service over Decentralized Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26182v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario. In this paper, we present Parallax, a decentralized LLM serving system that turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation, which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii) request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable substrate for LLM inference.

| **['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.</p></details> | 8 pages, no figures |
| **[Vocabulary Customization for Efficient Domain-Specific LLM Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26124v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word splits. We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of tokens as before. Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NEURIPS 2025 CCFM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[SafeEvalAgent: Toward Agentic and Self-Evolving Safety Evaluation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26100v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However, existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23058v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26072v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 5 Tables, 1 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Ban&Pick: Ehancing Performance and Efficiency of MoE-LLMs via Smarter Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency at inference. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban further dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban\&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the vLLM.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Meta-Analysis of LLM Effects on Students across Qualification, Socialisation, and Subjectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22725v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as solutions for education, yet evaluations often reduce their impact to narrow performance metrics. This paper reframes the question by asking "what kind of impact should LLMs have in education?" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188). Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but what futures they enable or foreclose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26041v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Metis: Training LLMs with FP4 Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00404v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as the fundamental barrier to low-bit training of large language models (LLMs). These spectra are dominated by a small fraction of large singular values, inducing wide numerical ranges that cause quantization bias and severe spectral distortion, ultimately degrading training performance. This work presents Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for independent quantization, thereby reducing errors and preserving spectral structure. To minimize overhead, Metis leverages two key properties of the dominant spectral subspace: preservation via sparsely random sampling and preservation via random projection, reducing decomposition cost to a negligible level. On LLaMA-3 8B trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust W4A4G4 training with FP4 quantization of weights, activations, and gradients, yielding only a 0.4% training loss gap and a 0.1% degradation in downstream accuracy relative to BF16. Beyond matching BF16 fidelity, Metis also surpasses our implementation of Nvidia's recently announced (yet to be publicly released) FP4 recipe, consistently achieving lower loss and higher downstream accuracy while incurring significantly lower computational overhead. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Metis-quantization-644B.</p></details> |  |

| **[R-Log: Incentivizing Log Analysis Capability in LLMs via Reasoning-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25987v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function. Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by 228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the efficacy.</p></details> |  |

In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

This specification defines standard claims, endpoints, and protocols that address these requirements while maintaining compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect infrastructure. The proposed framework introduces mechanisms for agent identity representation, delegation chain validation, attestation verification, and capability-based authorization, providing a foundation for secure and trustworthy agent-to-service interactions in modern distributed systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 2 code listings.

| **[Hierarchical Balance Packing: Towards Efficient Supervised Fine-tuning for Long-Context LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07680v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue, but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MoE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/HBP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25919v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast, similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACLW 2025 (WOAH); fix typo</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Dynamic Ensembling for Multiple LLM Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07448v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, the strengths of LLMs can vary due to different architectures, model sizes, areas of training data, etc. Therefore, ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks. However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process, wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method uses fewer computational resources to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

It is well-known that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT (4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens' existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens' appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23% long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we identify four key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations. Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm, privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion. Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dagger Behind Smile: Fool LLMs with a Happy Ending Story](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13115v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from $\textit{jailbreak}$ attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious contents. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request. This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[SAIL: SRAM-Accelerated LLM Inference System with Lookup-Table-based GEMV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25853v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference requires substantial computational resources, yet CPU-based inference remains essential for democratizing AI due to the widespread availability of CPUs compared to specialized accelerators. However, efficient LLM inference on CPUs faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing CPU architectures struggle with low-precision arithmetic required by quantized models, where optimal bit precision varies across models and layers; and (2) the memory-bound nature of the token generation phase creates severe performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose SAIL (SRAM-Accelerated Inference of LLMs), a CPU-based inference solution that efficiently supports arbitrary bit precisions with minimal overhead. SAIL integrates three key innovations: First, we introduce Batched LUT-based General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (LUT-GEMV) with SRAM-based processing-in-memory, enabling high data reuse through lookup tables and reducing memory movement. Second, our Pattern-Aware LUT optimization identifies and exploits redundancy in input activation patterns, reducing computation cycles by 13.8\%. Third, we develop an in-memory type conversion algorithm that leverages PIM's parallelism for efficient de-/quantization operations, alleviating pressure on CPU's vector units. Our architecture requires only 2\% hardware overhead and a single new instruction, while maintaining dual functionality as both compute and storage units. Experimental evaluations using a modified gem5 simulator demonstrate that SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup and 19.9x higher tokens per dollar compared to ARM Neoverse-N1 CPU baselines, and up to 7.04x better cost efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs, establishing a practical path for efficient CPU-based LLM inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning, where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions. However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and "cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[VELA: An LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge Approach for Evaluating Long Image Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25818v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions. Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection: A Comparison of DNN and LLM Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25795v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure.

| **[QuestA: Expanding Reasoning Capacity in LLMs via Question Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13266v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks. Yet recent studies question RL's ability to incentivize reasoning capacity beyond the base model. This raises a key challenge: how can RL be adapted to solve harder reasoning problems more effectively? To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 72.50% (+10.73%) on AIME24, 62.29% (+12.79%) on AIME25, and 41.67% (+10.11%) on HMMT25.

| **[V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25773v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TruthRL: Incentivizing Truthful LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25760v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rotation Control Unlearning: Quantifying and Controlling Continuous Unlearning for LLM with The Cognitive Rotation Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25743v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data. However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore, we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests, effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |
