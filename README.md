| **[iGRPO: Self-Feedback-Driven LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09000v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving complex mathematical problems, yet they still fall short of producing accurate and consistent solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\% and 79.64\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | Tech report |

Clinical notes capture a patient's private vulnerability and individuality, which are used for care coordination and research. Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, these notes are de-identified to protect patient privacy. However, Safe Harbor was designed for an era of categorical tabular data, focusing on the removal of explicit identifiers while ignoring the latent information found in correlations between identity and quasi-identifiers, which can be captured by modern LLMs. We first formalize these correlations using a causal graph, then validate it empirically through individual re-identification of patients from scrubbed notes. The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone. This position paper raises the question of how we can act as a community to uphold patient-provider trust when de-identification is inherently imperfect. We aim to raise awareness and discuss actionable recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[f-GRPO and Beyond: Divergence-Based Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for General LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05946v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Masked Finetuning: An Efficient Way to Mitigate Memorization of PIIs in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03310v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic In-Domain Exemplar Construction and LLM-Based Refinement of Multi-LLM Expansions for Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08917v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query expansion with large language models is promising but often relies on hand-crafted prompts, manually chosen exemplars, or a single LLM, making it non-scalable and sensitive to domain shift. We present an automated, domain-adaptive QE framework that builds in-domain exemplar pools by harvesting pseudo-relevant passages using a BM25-MonoT5 pipeline. A training-free cluster-based strategy selects diverse demonstrations, yielding strong and stable in-context QE without supervision. To further exploit model complementarity, we introduce a two-LLM ensemble in which two heterogeneous LLMs independently generate expansions and a refinement LLM consolidates them into one coherent expansion. Across TREC DL20, DBPedia, and SciFact, the refined ensemble delivers consistent and statistically significant gains over BM25, Rocchio, zero-shot, and fixed few-shot baselines. The framework offers a reproducible testbed for exemplar selection and multi-LLM generation, and a practical, label-free solution for real-world QE.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSS: Gated Subspace Steering for Selective Memorization Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08901v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can memorize and reproduce training sequences verbatim -- a tendency that undermines both generalization and privacy. Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives. Furthermore, we provide new theoretical insights into the geometry of memorization in neural representations.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |
| **[OmniReview: A Large-scale Benchmark and LLM-enhanced Framework for Realistic Reviewer Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08896v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic peer review remains the cornerstone of scholarly validation, yet the field faces some challenges in data and methods. From the data perspective, existing research is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, verified benchmarks and oversimplified evaluation metrics that fail to reflect real-world editorial workflows. To bridge this gap, we present OmniReview, a comprehensive dataset constructed by integrating multi-source academic platforms encompassing comprehensive scholarly profiles through the disambiguation pipeline, yielding 202, 756 verified review records. Based on this data, we introduce a three-tier hierarchical evaluaion framework to assess recommendations from recall to precise expert identification. From the method perspective, existing embedding-based approaches suffer from the information bottleneck of semantic compression and limited interpretability. To resolve these method limitations, we propose Profiling Scholars with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (Pro-MMoE), a novel framework that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-task Learning. Specifically, it utilizes LLM-generated semantic profiles to preserve fine-grained expertise nuances and interpretability, while employing a Task-Adaptive MMoE architecture to dynamically balance conflicting evaluation goals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Pro-MMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across six of seven metrics, establishing a new benchmark for realistic reviewer recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whose Name Comes Up? Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-Inspired Masked Fine-Tuning for Knowledge Injection in Autoregressive LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often used in environments where facts evolve, yet factual knowledge updates via fine-tuning on unstructured text often suffers from 1) reliance on compute-heavy paraphrase augmentation and 2) the reversal curse. Recent studies show diffusion large language models (dLLMs) require fewer training samples to achieve lower loss in pre-training and are more resistant to the reversal curse, suggesting dLLMs may learn new knowledge more easily than autoregressive LLMs (arLLMs). We test this hypothesis in controlled knowledge fine-tuning experiments and find that while arLLMs rely on paraphrase augmentation to generalize knowledge text into question-answering (QA) capability, dLLMs do not require paraphrases to achieve high QA accuracy. To further investigate whether the demasking objective alone can induce such a knowledge injection advantage in dLLMs regardless of their diffusion denoising paradigm, we propose masked fine-tuning for arLLMs, which prompts an arLLM to reconstruct the original text given a masked version in context. The masked fine-tuning for arLLMs substantially improves the efficacy of knowledge injection, i.e. no paraphrase needed and resistant to the reversal curse, closing the gap between arLLMs and dLLMs. We also demonstrate that the same demasking objective improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on math tasks over standard SFT, suggesting broader applicability of the demasking objective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr. MAS: Stable Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08847v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent LLM systems enable advanced reasoning and tool use via role specialization, yet reliable reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for such systems remains difficult. In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\% avg@16 and +4.6\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\% avg@16 and +13.1\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes. Moreover, it remains highly effective under heterogeneous agent-model assignments while improving efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[SearchAttack: Red-Teaming LLMs against Knowledge-to-Action Threats under Online Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04093v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, people have suffered from LLM hallucination and have become increasingly aware of the reliability gap of LLMs in open and knowledge-intensive tasks. As a result, they have increasingly turned to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, LLM-driven search also becomes an attractive target for misuse. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful instructions or takeaways for users, it becomes difficult to withdraw or undo such exposure. To investigate LLMs' unsafe search behavior issues, we first propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming, which (1) rephrases harmful semantics via dense and benign knowledge to evade direct in-context decoding, thus eliciting unsafe information retrieval, (2) stress-tests LLMs' reward-chasing bias by steering them to synthesize unsafe retrieved content. We also curate an emergent, domain-specific illicit activity benchmark for search-based threat assessment, and introduce a fact-checking framework to ground and quantify harm in both offline and online attack settings. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems. We also find that LLMs without web search can still be steered into harmful content output due to their information-seeking stereotypical behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Misus...</summary><p>Misusing LLM-driven search for harmful information-seeking poses serious risks.

| **[NRR-Phi: Text-to-State Mapping for Ambiguity Preservation in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19933v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models exhibit a systematic tendency toward early semantic commitment: given ambiguous input, they collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single response before sufficient context is available. We present a formal framework for text-to-state mapping ($φ: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{S}$) that transforms natural language into a non-collapsing state space where multiple interpretations coexist. The mapping decomposes into three stages: conflict detection, interpretation extraction, and state construction. We instantiate $φ$ with a hybrid extraction pipeline combining rule-based segmentation for explicit conflict markers (adversative conjunctions, hedging expressions) with LLM-based enumeration of implicit ambiguity (epistemic, lexical, structural). On a test set of 68 ambiguous sentences, the resulting states preserve interpretive multiplicity: mean state entropy $H = 1.087$ bits across ambiguity categories, compared to $H = 0$ for collapse-based baselines. We additionally instantiate the rule-based conflict detector for Japanese markers to illustrate cross-lingual portability. This framework extends Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) by providing the missing algorithmic bridge between text and the NRR state space, enabling architectural collapse deferment in LLM inference. Design principles for state-to-state transformations are detailed in the Appendix, with empirical validation on 580 test cases showing 0% collapse for principle-satisfying operators versus up to 17.8% for violating operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables.

| **[AMEM4Rec: Leveraging Cross-User Similarity for Memory Evolution in Agentic LLM Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08837v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommender systems but remain hindered by several challenges. Fine-tuning LLMs is parameter-inefficient, and prompt-based agentic reasoning is limited by context length and hallucination risk. Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model. Extensive experiments on Amazon and MIND datasets show that AMEM4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolving memory-guided collaborative filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[InSPO: Unlocking Intrinsic Self-Reflection for LLM Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23126v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (InSPO), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. InSPO serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs. Our Code is available at https://github.com/Skylanding/InSPO.</p></details> |  |

Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.</p></details> | 53 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Evaluating Kubernetes Performance for GenAI Inference: From Automatic Speech Recognition to LLM Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04900v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Generative AI (GenAI), particularly inference, rapidly emerges as a dominant workload category, the Kubernetes ecosystem is proactively evolving to natively support its unique demands. This industry paper demonstrates how emerging Kubernetes-native projects can be combined to deliver the benefits of container orchestration, such as scalability and resource efficiency, to complex AI workflows. We implement and evaluate an illustrative, multi-stage use case consisting of automatic speech recognition and summarization. First, we address batch inference by using Kueue to manage jobs that transcribe audio files with Whisper models and Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) to increase parallel job execution. Second, we address a discrete online inference scenario by feeding the transcripts to a Large Language Model for summarization hosted using llm-d, a novel solution utilizing the recent developments around the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) for optimized routing of inference requests. Our findings illustrate that these complementary components (Kueue, DAS, and GAIE) form a cohesive, high-performance platform, proving Kubernetes' capability to serve as a unified foundation for demanding GenAI workloads: Kueue reduced total makespan by up to 15%; DAS shortened mean job completion time by 36%; and GAIE improved Time to First Token by 82\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>A acc...</summary><p>A accepted at the 17th International Conference on Performance Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Tree Training: Accelerating Agentic LLMs Training via Shared Prefix Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00413v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic large language model (LLM) training often involves multi-turn interaction trajectories that branch into multiple execution paths due to concurrent tool use, think-mode, sub-agent, context management and other runtime designs. As a result, the token produced by a single task naturally forms a tree-structured token trajectory with shared prefixes, rather than a linear sequence. Existing training pipelines linearize such trajectories and treat each branch independently, leading to substantial redundant computation in both forward and backward passes. To eliminate such redundancy, we introduce Tree Training, an efficient training framework for tree-structured trajectories. Its core component, Gradient Restoration, enables correct gradient aggregation across shared prefixes, allowing each prefix to be computed exactly once while remaining mathematically equivalent to independent training on all branches. To support large trajectory trees in practice, we redesign the training engine to natively ingest tree-structured data and propose Tree Packing, a memory-efficient partitioning strategy that preserves high prefix reuse. Experiments conducted on dense and MOE models of real-world agentic trajectories show 6.2x training speedup for both supervised fine-tuning and the model update phase in reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing Multilingual Representations in LLMs with Cross-Layer Transcoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10840v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train models on different multilingual mixtures and analyze their internal mechanisms using Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLTs) and Attribution Graphs. Our results reveal multilingual shared representations: the model employs highly similar features across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Training models without English shows identical multilingual shared space structures. Decoding relies partly on a small set of high-frequency features in the final layers, which linearly encode language identity from early layers. Intervening on these features allows one language to be suppressed and another substituted. Finally, to explain non-English failures, we perform a Model-Diffing experiment: underperformance arises from dim late-layer features, weak middle-layer clusters, and tokenizer bias toward English that forces early layers to specialize in word reassembly. Finetuning strengthens these features and their links, improving token assembly and language-specific decoding, providing a mechanistic explanation for multilingual gaps. Our models and CLTs are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/CausalNLP/multilingual-clts and https://huggingface.co/collections/CausalNLP/multilingual-gpt2-models.

We present Guardian Angel, a low-cost, screenless wearable paired with a WhatsApp-based LLM agent that delivers plain-language, personalized insights. The LLM operates directly on raw, noisy sensor waveforms and is robust to the poor signal quality of low-cost hardware. On a benchmark dataset, a standard open-source algorithm produced valid outputs for only 70.29% of segments, whereas Guardian Angel achieved 100% availability (reported as coverage under field noise, distinct from accuracy), yielding a continuous and understandable physiological record. In a 96-hour study involving 20 participants (1,920 participant-hours), users demonstrated significant improvements in health data comprehension and mindfulness of vital signs. These results suggest a practical approach to enhancing health literacy and adoption in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

The cross-file context typically contains different types of information (e.g., relevant APIs and similar code) and is lengthy. In this paper, we found that LLMs struggle to fully utilize the information in the cross-file context. We hypothesize that one of the root causes of the limitation is the misalignment between pre-training (i.e., relying on nearby context) and repo-level code completion (i.e., frequently attending to long-range cross-file context). To address the above misalignment, we propose Code Long-context Alignment - COLA, a purely data-driven approach to explicitly teach LLMs to focus on the cross-file context. Specifically, COLA constructs a large-scale repo-level code completion dataset - COLA-132K, where each sample contains the long cross-file context (up to 128K tokens) and requires generating context-aware code (i.e., cross-file API invocations and code spans similar to cross-file context). Through a two-stage training pipeline upon COLA-132K, LLMs learn the capability of finding relevant information in the cross-file context, thus aligning LLMs with repo-level code completion. We apply COLA to multiple popular LLMs (e.g., aiXcoder-7B) and extensive experiments on COLA-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval. Our experiments yield the following results. 1) Effectiveness. COLA substantially improves the performance of multiple LLMs in repo-level code completion. For example, it improves aiXcoder-7B by up to 19.7% in exact match. 2) Generalizability. The capability learned by COLA can generalize to new languages. 3) Enhanced Context Utilization Capability. We design two probing experiments, which show COLA improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the information in cross-file context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ASE2025</p></details> |

However, human rubrics are often static and misaligned with how models internally represent language quality. We introduce GER-Eval (Generating Evaluation Rubrics for Evaluation) to investigate whether LLMs can design and apply their own evaluation rubrics. We evaluate the semantic coherence and scoring reliability of LLM-defined criteria and their alignment with human criteria. LLMs reliably generate interpretable and task-aware evaluation dimensions and apply them consistently within models, but their scoring reliability degrades in factual and knowledge-intensive settings. Closed-source models such as GPT-4o achieve higher agreement and cross-model generalization than open-weight models such as Llama. Our findings position evaluation as a learned linguistic capability of LLMs, consistent within models but fragmented across them, and call for new methods that jointly model human and LLM evaluative language to improve reliability and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL 2026 Findings</p></details> |

Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supporting Effective Goal Setting with LLM-Based Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08636v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each day, individuals set behavioral goals such as eating healthier, exercising regularly, or increasing productivity. While psychological frameworks (i.e., goal setting and implementation intentions) can be helpful, they often need structured external support, which interactive technologies can provide. We thus explored how large language model (LLM)-based chatbots can apply these frameworks to guide users in setting more effective goals. We conducted a preregistered randomized controlled experiment ($N = 543$) comparing chatbots with different combinations of three design features: guidance, suggestions, and feedback. We evaluated goal quality using subjective and objective measures. We found that, while guidance is already helpful, it is the addition of feedback that makes LLM-based chatbots effective in supporting participants' goal setting. In contrast, adaptive suggestions were less effective. Altogether, our study shows how to design chatbots by operationalizing psychological frameworks to provide effective support for reaching behavioral goals.</p></details> |  |

To avoid costly agent training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference;27 pages,15 figures</p></details> |
| **[Do Multilingual LLMs have specialized language heads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08625v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity for their ability to process and generate text across multiple languages. However, deploying these models in production can be inefficient when only a subset of the supported languages is of interest. There has been some research conducted on identifying whether machine translation models have language-specific or language-agnostic heads, however no research has been conducted for multilingual LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, that as we know are capable of performing diverse tasks beyond just translation. This paper explores whether multilingual LLMs have specialized language attention heads for each language, and investigates the possibility of removing language-specific heads for unwanted languages without degrading performance in the targeted languages. Our findings could inform more efficient deployment strategies for multilingual LLMs, enabling reduced model complexity while maintaining high accuracy for targeted languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Models, Sparse Safety: Unsafe Routes in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08621v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevailing autoregressive paradigm imposes strict serial constraints, limiting generation efficiency and introducing exposure bias. In this paper, we investigate Masked Diffusion Modeling~(MDM) as a non-autoregressive paradigm for speech LLMs and introduce VocalNet-MDM. To adapt MDM for streaming speech interaction, we address two critical challenges: training-inference mismatch and iterative overhead. We propose Hierarchical Block-wise Masking to align training objectives with the progressive masked states encountered during block diffusion decoding, and Iterative Self-Distillation to compress multi-step refinement into fewer steps for low-latency inference. Trained on a limited scale of only 6K hours of speech data, VocalNet-MDM achieves a 3.7$\times$--10$\times$ decoding speedup and reduces first-chunk latency by 34\% compared to AR baselines. It maintains competitive recognition accuracy while achieving state-of-the-art text quality and speech naturalness, demonstrating that MDM is a promising and scalable alternative for low-latency, efficient speech LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown broad capabilities, even state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving continuous black-box optimization tasks and struggle to maintain exploration-exploitation balance. We introduce GPTOpt, an optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization capabilities by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B on structured Bayesian optimization (BO) data, including surrogate model information. This provides an explainable framework calibrated to produce surrogate model outputs comparable to a Gaussian process, while keeping the advantages of flexible LLM-based optimization. On a variety of black-box optimization benchmarks, our model shows favorable performance compared to traditional optimizers and transformer-based alternatives, while providing important context and insight into the model's decisions.</p></details> |  |

To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets, indicating a deeper signal than dataset-specific spurious features, and outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers and, notably, generalisation falters on questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM internals.</p></details> |  |

While value alignment is typically evaluated for isolated models, how value perturbations propagate through agent interactions remains poorly understood. We present ValueFlow, a perturbation-based evaluation framework for measuring and analyzing value drift in multi-agent systems. ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs. Experiments across multiple model backbones, prompt personas, value dimensions, and network structures show that susceptibility varies widely across values and is strongly shaped by structural topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments. To promote future research, we release code and data at: https://github.com/microsoft/implicitMemory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE SaTML 2026</p></details> |

One strategy that many universities pursue is to customize pre-trained LLM as-a-service (LLMaaS). While most studies on LLMaaS chatbots prioritize technical adaptations, we focus on psychological effects of user-salient customizations, such as interface changes. We assume that such customizations influence users' perception of the system and are therefore important in guiding safe and appropriate use. In a field study, we examine how students and employees (N = 526) at a German university perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS chatbot compared to ChatGPT. Participants using both systems (n = 116) reported greater trust, higher perceived privacy and less experienced hallucinations with their university's customized LLMaaS chatbot in contrast to ChatGPT. We discuss theoretical implications for research on calibrated trust, and offer guidance on the design and deployment of LLMaaS chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2026)</p></details> |

The first is that LLMs trap themselves into local optima and the second is that they lack exhaustive coverage of the solution space. To investigate and improve these two issues, we propose Lyria, a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework building on the integration of LLMs, genetic algorithms, and symbolic systems, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated the efficacy of Lyria. Furthermore, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its performance. In addition, based on Lyria, we extend the ideas to the fine-tuning process of LLMs and introduce LAFT which enables a weaker model to imitate the reasoning process of a stronger model that reason under the Lyria reasoning framework. We demonstrate that the significant effectiveness of LAFT by conducting extensive experiments against 9 constructed baselines. We finally reveal the limitations and provide insights into future directions.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward -- so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.

| **[Hybrid Pooling with LLMs via Relevance Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08457v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality relevance judgements over large query sets are essential for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems, yet manual annotation remains costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as automatic relevance assessors, but their reliability is still limited. Most existing approaches rely on zero-shot prompting or In-Context Learning (ICL) with a small number of labeled examples. However, standard ICL treats examples as independent instances and fails to explicitly capture the underlying relevance criteria of a topic, restricting its ability to generalize to unseen query-document pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce Relevance Context Learning (RCL), a novel framework that leverages human relevance judgements to explicitly model topic-specific relevance criteria. Rather than directly using labeled examples for in-context prediction, RCL first prompts an LLM (Instructor LLM) to analyze sets of judged query-document pairs and generate explicit narratives that describe what constitutes relevance for a given topic. These relevance narratives are then used as structured prompts to guide a second LLM (Assessor LLM) in producing relevance judgements. To evaluate RCL in a realistic data collection setting, we propose a hybrid pooling strategy in which a shallow depth-\textit{k} pool from participating systems is judged by human assessors, while the remaining documents are labeled by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RCL substantially outperforms zero-shot prompting and consistently improves over standard ICL. Overall, our findings indicate that transforming relevance examples into explicit, context-aware relevance narratives is a more effective way of exploiting human judgements for LLM-based IR dataset construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs + Security = Trouble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08422v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that when it comes to producing secure code with AI, the prevailing "fighting fire with fire" approach -- using probabilistic AI-based checkers or attackers to secure probabilistically generated code -- fails to address the long tail of security bugs. As a result, systems may remain exposed to zero-day vulnerabilities that can be discovered by better-resourced or more persistent adversaries. While neurosymbolic approaches that combine LLMs with formal methods are attractive in principle, we argue that they are difficult to reconcile with the "vibe coding" workflow common in LLM-assisted development: unless the end-to-end verification pipeline is fully automated, developers are repeatedly asked to validate specifications, resolve ambiguities, and adjudicate failures, making the human-in-the-loop a likely point of weakness, compromising secure-by-construction guarantees. In this paper we argue that stronger security guarantees can be obtained by enforcing security constraints during code generation (e.g., via constrained decoding), rather than relying solely on post-hoc detection and repair. This direction is particularly promising for diffusion-style code models, whose approach provides a natural elegant opportunity for modular, hierarchical security enforcement, allowing us to combine lower-latency generation techniques with generating secure-by-construction code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Intent-Based Multi-Robot Task Planner with LLM Oracles on Hyperledger Fabric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08421v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for transforming natural language user intents into executable actions. This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use.</p></details> |  |

We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm shifts control from deterministic code to probabilistic inference, creating a fundamental Trust-Authorization Mismatch: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we survey more than 200 representative papers to categorize the emerging landscape of agent security. We propose the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework as a unifying formal lens. By decomposing agent execution into three distinct stages-Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant-we demonstrate that diverse threats, from prompt injection to tool poisoning, share a common root cause: the desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization boundaries. Using the B-I-P lens, we systematically map existing attacks and defenses and identify critical gaps where current mechanisms fail to bridge this mismatch. Finally, we outline a research agenda for shifting from static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, it is challenging due to the frequent occurrence of training anomalies. Since existing diagnostic tools are narrowly tailored to specific issues, there are gaps in their ability to address anomalies spanning the entire training stack. In response, we introduce Flare, a diagnostic framework designed for distributed LLM training at scale. Flare first integrates a lightweight tracing daemon for full-stack and backend-extensible tracing. Additionally, it features a diagnostic engine that automatically diagnoses anomalies, with a focus on performance regressions. The deployment of Flare across 6,000 GPUs has demonstrated significant improvements in pinpointing deficiencies in real-world scenarios, with continuous operation for over eight months.</p></details> |  |

Despite the substantial compute costs of these ablations, existing open-source frameworks provide limited tooling for these experiments, often forcing researchers to write their own wrappers and scripts. We propose Modalities, an end-to-end PyTorch-native framework that integrates data-driven LLM research with large-scale model training from two angles. Firstly, by integrating state-of-the-art parallelization strategies, it enables both efficient pretraining and systematic ablations at trillion-token and billion-parameter scale. Secondly, Modalities adopts modular design with declarative, self-contained configuration, enabling reproducibility and extensibility levels that are difficult to achieve out-of-the-box with existing LLM training frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Real-World Industrial-Scale Verification: LLM-Driven Theorem Proving on seL4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08384v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal methods (FM) are reliable but costly to apply, often requiring years of expert effort in industrial-scale projects such as seL4, especially for theorem proving. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated theorem proving increasingly feasible. However, most prior work focuses on mathematics-oriented benchmarks such as miniF2F, with limited evaluation on real-world verification projects. The few studies that consider industrial-scale verification mostly rely on closed-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, which cannot be locally deployed and incur substantial usage costs. In this paper, we propose AutoReal, an LLM-driven theorem proving method for real-world industrial-scale systems with support for lightweight local deployment. We evaluate AutoReal on the seL4-Isabelle verification project as a representative and challenging case study. AutoReal incorporates two key improvements: (1) chain-of-thought (CoT)-based proof training, which teaches the LLM the reasoning behind proof steps and enables step-wise explanations alongside proofs, and (2) context augmentation, which leverages proof context from the project to enhance LLM-driven proving. Based on the AutoReal methodology, we fine-tune a base model to obtain AutoReal-Prover, a compact 7B-scale prover for industrial-scale theorem proving. AutoReal-Prover achieves a 51.67% proof success rate on 660 theorems from seL4-designated Important Theories across all 10 seL4 proof categories, substantially outperforming prior attempts on seL4 (27.06%). To evaluate generalization, we further apply AutoReal-Prover to three security-related projects from the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP), covering all 451 theorems and achieving a proof success rate of 53.88%. Overall, this work advances the application of LLM-driven theorem proving in real-world industrial-scale verification.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, this work attempts to study using LLM-based agents to design collaborative AI systems autonomously. To explore this problem, we first introduce ComfyBench to evaluate agents's ability to design collaborative AI systems in ComfyUI. ComfyBench is a comprehensive benchmark comprising 200 diverse tasks covering various instruction-following generation challenges, along with detailed annotations for 3,205 nodes and 20 workflows. Based on ComfyBench, we further develop ComfyAgent, a novel framework that empowers LLM-based agents to autonomously design collaborative AI systems by generating workflows. ComfyAgent is based on two core concepts. First, it represents workflows with code, which can be reversibly converted into workflows and executed as collaborative systems by the interpreter. Second, it constructs a multi-agent system that cooperates to learn from existing workflows and generate new workflows for a given task. While experimental results demonstrate that ComfyAgent achieves a comparable resolve rate to o1-preview and significantly surpasses other agents on ComfyBench, ComfyAgent has resolved only 15\% of creative tasks. LLM-based agents still have a long way to go in autonomously designing collaborative AI systems. Progress with ComfyBench is paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous collaborative AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the LLM judges induce bias in naive evaluation scores. We propose a simple plug-in framework that corrects this bias and enables statistically principled uncertainty quantification. Our framework constructs confidence intervals that account for uncertainty from both the test dataset and a human-labeled calibration dataset. Additionally, it uses an adaptive strategy to allocate calibration samples for tighter intervals. Importantly, we characterize parameter regimes defined by the true evaluation score and the LLM judge's sensitivity and specificity in which our LLM-based evaluation yields more reliable estimates than human-only evaluation. Moreover, we show that our framework remains unbiased under distribution shift between the test and calibration datasets, in contrast to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>Refined the writing of the manuscript</p></details> |

However, jointly optimizing both data and model configurations is often deemed intractable, and existing methods focus on either data or model optimization without considering their interaction. We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget.</p></details> |  |

However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$Δ$, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$Δ$ employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$Δ$ follows a two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity. Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that Legal$Δ$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Level LLM Collaboration via FusionRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05106v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |

We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized 8B-scale LLM for Triton programming, trained via a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework. While Triton synthesis faces unique challenges, including data scarcity and a high susceptibility to reward hacking, our approach enables robust kernel generation through two primary innovations. First, we implement a multi-layered verification system that provides high-fidelity reward signals, ensuring that generated kernels are both syntactically and functionally valid. Second, we propose Hierarchical Reward Decomposition (HRD), which decouples reinforcement for high-level reasoning and low-level implementation to resolve the credit assignment problem in long-sequence generation. Comprehensive evaluations on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and runtime speedup, outperforming concurrent Triton-specific models and matching the performance of frontier models with over 100B parameters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of hardware-aware RL paradigms in specialized domain adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Formalizing LLM-Based Agent Designs through Structural Context Modeling and Semantic Dynamics Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08276v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on large language model (LLM) agents is fragmented: discussions of conceptual frameworks and methodological principles are frequently intertwined with low-level implementation details, causing both readers and authors to lose track amid a proliferation of superficially distinct concepts. We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel gating-based KV cache eviction method for frozen-weight LLMs that achieves high compression ratios with negligible computational cost. Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-1M, Qwen3, and Gemma3 families show that our method maintains near-lossless performance while evicting up to 70% of the KV cache. The results are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including long-context understanding, code comprehension, and mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/Janghyun1230/FastKVzip</p></details> |

However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixed...</summary><p>fixed Nikhil Singh's affiliation</p></details> |

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiCoEvalChain: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Framework for Collaborative LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08229v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands increasingly reliable evaluation, yet current centralized evaluation suffers from opacity, overfitting, and hardware-induced variance. Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a "centralized black box" into a "decentralized endorsement" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23075v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient methods for Large Language Models optimize a policy $π_θ$ via a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. However, modern LLM-RL pipelines suffer from unavoidable implementation divergences -- backend discrepancies, Mixture-of-Experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness -- causing off-policy mismatch ($π_{\text{roll}} \neq π_θ$) and approximation errors between the surrogate and the true objective. We demonstrate that classical trust region bounds on this error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. To address this, we derive a family of bounds -- both KL-based and TV-based -- including a Pinsker-Marginal bound ($O(T^{3/2})$), a Mixed bound ($O(T)$), and an Adaptive bound that strictly generalizes the Pinsker-Marginal bound via per-position importance-ratio decomposition. Taking the minimum over all bounds yields the tightest known guarantee across all divergence regimes. Crucially, all bounds depend on the maximum token-level divergence $D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\mathrm{tok,max}}$ (or $D_{\mathrm{TV}}^{\mathrm{tok,max}}$), a sequence-level quantity that cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which masks entire sequences violating the trust region, enabling the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrugR: Optimizing Molecular Drugs through LLM-based Explicit Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08213v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule generation and optimization is a fundamental task in chemical domain. The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs and people both learn to form conventions -- just not with each other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08208v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans align to one another in conversation -- adopting shared conventions that ease communication. We test whether LLMs form the same kinds of conventions in a multimodal communication game. Both humans and LLMs display evidence of convention-formation (increasing the accuracy and consistency of their turns while decreasing their length) when communicating in same-type dyads (humans with humans, AI with AI). However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs. These results suggest that conversational alignment requires more than just the ability to mimic previous interactions, but also shared interpretative biases toward the meanings that are conveyed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Achilles' Heel of LLMs: How Altering a Handful of Neurons Can Cripple Language Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10238v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions, rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in safety-critical applications.

| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

An Iterative Design Study in Emergency Preparedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21868v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policymakers must often act under conditions of deep uncertainty, such as emergency response, where predicting the specific impacts of a policy apriori is implausible. Large Language Model (LLM) agent simulations have been proposed as tools to support policymakers under these conditions, yet little is known about how such simulations become useful for real-world policy practice. To address this gap, we conducted a year-long, stakeholder-engaged design process with a university emergency preparedness team. Through iterative design cycles, we developed and refined an LLM agent simulation of a large-scale campus gathering, ultimately scaling to 13,000 agents that modeled crowd movement and communication under various emergency scenarios. Rather than producing predictive forecasts, these simulations supported policy practice by shaping volunteer training, evacuation procedures, and infrastructure planning. Analyzing these findings, we identify three design process implications for making LLM agent simulations that are useful for policy practice: start from verifiable scenarios to bootstrap trust, use preliminary simulations to elicit tacit domain knowledge, and treat simulation capabilities and policy implementation as co-evolving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test vs Mutant: Adversarial LLM Agents for Robust Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08146v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing is a critical, yet resource-intensive phase of the software development lifecycle. Over the years, various automated tools have been developed to aid in this process. Search-based approaches typically achieve high coverage but produce tests with low readability, whereas large language model (LLM)-based methods generate more human-readable tests but often suffer from low coverage and compilability. While the majority of research efforts have focused on improving test coverage and readability, little attention has been paid to enhancing the robustness of bug detection, particularly in exposing corner cases and vulnerable execution paths. To address this gap, we propose AdverTest, a novel adversarial framework for LLM-powered test case generation. AdverTest comprises two interacting agents: a test case generation agent (T) and a mutant generation agent (M). These agents engage in an adversarial loop, where M persistently creates new mutants "hacking" the blind spots of T's current test suite, while T iteratively refines its test cases to "kill" the challenging mutants produced by M. This interaction loop is guided by both coverage and mutation scores, enabling the system to co-evolve toward both high test coverage and bug detection capability. Experimental results in the Defects4J dataset show that our approach improves fault detection rates by 8.56% over the best existing LLM-based methods and by 63.30% over EvoSuite, while also improving line and branch coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Domain-aware LLM Decoding for Continual Domain Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08088v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are typically fine-tuned offline on domain-specific data, assuming a static domain. In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline. These results demonstrate ODD 's robustness to evolving lexical and contextual patterns, making it suitable for dynamic LLM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Prompt Co-Evolution: Growing Test Sets to Refine LLM Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12728v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in applications, and people can shape model behavior by editing prompt instructions. Yet encoding subtle, domain-specific policies into prompts is challenging. Although this process often benefits from concrete test cases, test data and prompt instructions are typically developed as separate artifacts, reflecting traditional machine learning practices in which model tuning was slow and test sets were static. We argue that the fast, iterative nature of prompt engineering calls for removing this separation and enabling a new workflow: data-prompt co-evolution, where a living test set and prompt instructions evolve in tandem. We present an interactive system that operationalizes this workflow. It guides application developers to discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and iteratively evaluate revised prompts against a growing test set. A user study shows our workflow helps people refine prompts systematically, better aligning them with their intended policies. This work points toward more robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to CHI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Bandit Algorithms with LLMs for Time-varying User Preferences in Streaming Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08067v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world streaming recommender systems, user preferences evolve dynamically over time. Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Adaptable Detection of Malicious LLM Prompts via Bootstrap Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08062v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.</p></details> |  |

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AccML@HiPEAC 2026</p></details> |

Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are scaling over complexity against crushing, instance against hacking and exploitation, oversight for easy verification, and coverage for real-world relevance. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver, which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval, which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is not crushed by current models, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, and iii) the numbers of tokens in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. Through continuously scaling analysis, NPPC can provide critical insights into the limits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, exposing fundamental limitations and suggesting future directions for further improvements.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive, Scalable, and Robust Coordination of LLM Agents: A Dynamic Ad-Hoc Networking Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08009v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent architectures built on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to realize swarm intelligence through well-crafted collaboration. However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHERLOCK:Towards Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation in LLM-enhanced E-commerce Risk Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08948v3)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective e-commerce risk management requires in-depth case investigations to identify emerging fraud patterns in highly adversarial environments. However, manual investigation typically requires analyzing the associations and couplings among multi-source heterogeneous data, a labor-intensive process that limits efficiency. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating these analyses, their deployment is hindered by the complexity of risk scenarios and the sparsity of long-tail domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Sherlock, a framework that integrates structured domain knowledge with LLM-based reasoning through three core modules. First, we construct a domain Knowledge Base (KB) by distilling structured expertise from heterogeneous knowledge sources. Second, we design a two-stage retrieval-augmented generation strategy tailored for case investigation, which combines input contextual augmentation with a Reflect & Refine module to fully leverage the KB for improved analysis quality. Finally, we develop an integrated platform for operations and annotation to drive a self-evolving data flywheel. By combining real-time hotfixes through KB updates with periodic logic alignment via post-training, we facilitate continuous system evolution to counteract adversarial drifts. Online A/B tests at JD dot com demonstrate that Sherlock achieves an 82% Expert Acceptance Rate (EAR) and a 386.7% increase in daily investigation throughput. An additional 90-day evaluation shows that the flywheel successfully recovers from performance decay caused by changing tactics twice, raising the EAR ceiling by around 3.5% through autonomous model updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18851v4)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying LLM-generated code through watermarking poses a challenge in preserving functional correctness. Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For rigorous evaluation, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive metric that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal computational overhead. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Judge Who Never Admits: Hidden Shortcuts in LLM-based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07996v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as reasoning, question answering, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on content quality, remain invariant to irrelevant context, and transparently reflect the factors driving its decisions. We test this ideal via controlled cue perturbations-synthetic metadata labels injected into evaluation prompts-for six judge models: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemma-3-27B, Qwen3-235B, Claude-3-Haiku, and Llama3-70B. Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment.</p></details> |  |

Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows such devices to offload inference tasks to edge servers (ESs), yet introduces latency due to communication and serverside queuing, especially in multi-user environments. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware offloading framework that dynamically decides whether to perform inference locally or offload it to the ES, based on token-level uncertainty and resource constraints. We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries. Our experiments show that GOA consistently achieves a favorable trade-off, outperforming baseline strategies in both accuracy and latency across varying user densities, and operates with practical computation time. These results establish GOA as a scalable and effective solution for LLM inference in MEC environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshop: WS02-GAIMC: Mutual Facilitation of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Communications</p></details> |

We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65\%) and very low false positive rate (0.63\%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55\% precision, 4.70\% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.</p></details> |  |

Identifying valid instruments requires interdisciplinary knowledge, creativity, and contextual understanding, making it a non-trivial task. In this paper, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in this task. We perform a two-stage evaluation framework. First, we test whether LLMs can recover well-established instruments from the literature, assessing their ability to replicate standard reasoning. Second, we evaluate whether LLMs can identify and avoid instruments that have been empirically or theoretically discredited. Building on these results, we introduce IV Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, and refines IVs for a given treatment-outcome pair. We also introduce a statistical test to contextualize consistency in the absence of ground truth. Our results show the potential of LLMs to discover valid instrumental variables from a large observational database.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, there is a gap in research regarding the effectiveness of LLMs in non-English mental health support applications. To address this problem, we present a novel multilingual adaptation of widely-used mental health datasets, translated from English into six languages (e.g., Greek, Turkish, French, Portuguese, German, and Finnish). This dataset enables a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in detecting mental health conditions and assessing their severity across multiple languages. By experimenting with GPT and Llama, we observe considerable variability in performance across languages, despite being evaluated on the same translated dataset. This inconsistency underscores the complexities inherent in multilingual mental health support, where language-specific nuances and mental health data coverage can affect the accuracy of the models. Through comprehensive error analysis, we emphasize the risks of relying exclusively on LLMs in medical settings (e.g., their potential to contribute to misdiagnoses). Moreover, our proposed approach offers significant cost savings for multilingual tasks, presenting a major advantage for broad-scale implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Recurring Vulnerabilities from Black-Box LLM-Generated Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04894v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.</p></details> | Preprint |

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Value of Agent-Generated Tests for LLM-Based Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07900v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) code agents increasingly resolve repository-level issues by iteratively editing code, invoking tools, and validating candidate patches. In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget. To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. "Fill" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while "Squeeze" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating more than >50K LLM voting personas in 363 real-world voting elections, we disentangle how AI-generated choices differ from human choices and how this affects collective decision outcomes. Complex preferential ballot formats show significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections, which demonstrate higher consistency. Strikingly, proportional ballot aggregation methods such as equal shares prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans and fairer AI representation, especially for voters likely to abstain. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for building democratic resilience in scenarios of low voters turnout by voter fatigue: abstained voters are mitigated via AI representatives that recover representative and fair voting outcomes. These interdisciplinary insights provide decision support to policymakers and citizens for developing safeguards and policies for risks of using AI in democratic innovations.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, driven by the strong generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based generative recommendation has become increasingly popular. However, we observe that existing methods inevitably introduce systematic bias when estimating item-level preference distributions. Specifically, autoregressive generation suffers from incomplete coverage due to beam search pruning, while parallel generation distorts probabilities by assuming token independence. We attribute this issue to a fundamental modeling mismatch: these methods approximate item-level distributions via token-level generation, which inherently induces approximation errors. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that token-level generation cannot faithfully substitute item-level generation, leading to biased item distributions. To address this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ply \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{SimGR}), a framework that directly models item-level preference distributions in a shared latent space and ranks items by similarity, thereby aligning the modeling objective with recommendation and mitigating distributional distortion. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLM backbones show that SimGR consistently outperforms existing generative recommenders.

In this paper, we show that these methods break down in the presence of multiple valid answers, where disagreement among equally correct responses leads to systematic underestimation of confidence. To enable a systematic study of this phenomenon, we introduce MACE, a benchmark of 12,000 factual questions spanning six domains with varying numbers of correct answers. Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Confidence Aggregation (SCA), which aggregates confidence over multiple high-probability sampled responses. SCA achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance under mixed-answer settings while preserving strong calibration on single-answer questions.</p></details> |  |

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train HER models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 41pages, 10 figures |

Unlike prior e-commerce benchmarks, ShoppingComp introduces difficult product discovery queries with many constraints, while guaranteeing open-world products and enabling easy verification of agent outputs. The benchmark comprises 145 instances and 558 scenarios, curated by 35 experts to reflect authentic shopping needs. Results reveal stark limitations of current LLMs: even state-of-the-art models achieve low performance (e.g., 17.76\% for GPT-5.2, 15.82\% for Gemini-3-Pro).Error analysis reflects limitations in core agent competencies, including information grounding in open-world environments, reliable verification of multi-constraint requirements, consistent reasoning over noisy and conflicting evidence, and risk-aware decision making. By exposing these capability gaps, ShoppingComp characterizes the trust threshold that AI systems must cross before they can be proactively trusted for reliable real-world decision making.

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ACL ARR 2026, hyperlink to code repository provided in the abstract</p></details> |

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems. Finally, we validate our training recipe and key design choices via a detailed ablation study.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks. Notably, it enables compact 3B, 4B models to achieve reasoning capabilities on par with or exceeding those of larger proprietary LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and superior query efficiency.

This raises a fundamental question: Do LLMs even know how big these numbers are? We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

Both issues are linked to data imbalance, with certain groups of data samples significantly underrepresented, which in turn would compromise the accuracy, robustness and generalizability of the learned models. Recent advances have proposed leveraging the flexibility and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically built on transformer architectures, to generate synthetic samples and to augment the observed data. In the context of imbalanced data, LLMs are used to oversample underrepresented groups and have shown promising improvements. However, there is a clear lack of theoretical understanding of such synthetic data approaches. In this article, we develop novel theoretical foundations to systematically study the roles of synthetic samples in addressing imbalanced classification and spurious correlation. Specifically, we first explicitly quantify the benefits of synthetic oversampling. Next, we analyze the scaling dynamics in synthetic data augmentation, and derive the corresponding scaling law. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of transformer models to generate high-quality synthetic samples. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy of the LLM-based synthetic oversampling and augmentation.</p></details> | 92 pages, 9 figures |

However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is a crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

Automated Linter Configuration via DSL-Based LLM Compilation of Coding Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07783v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding standards are essential for maintaining consistent and high-quality code across teams and projects. Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters.</p></details> | Accepted By FSE2026 |
| **[Attn-GS: Attention-Guided Context Compression for Efficient Personalized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07778v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual users requires incorporating extensive interaction histories and profiles, but input token constraints make this impractical due to high inference latency and API costs. Existing approaches rely on heuristic methods such as selecting recent interactions or prompting summarization models to compress user profiles. However, these methods treat context as a monolithic whole and fail to consider how LLMs internally process and prioritize different profile components. We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression. Through preliminary studies on representative personalization tasks, we discover that (a) LLMs' attention patterns naturally reveal important signals, and (b) fine-tuning enhances LLMs' ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. Based on these insights, we propose Attn-GS, an attention-guided context compression framework that leverages attention feedback from a marking model to mark important personalization sentences, then guides a compression model to generate task-relevant, high-quality compressed user contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Attn-GS significantly outperforms various baselines across different tasks, token limits, and settings, achieving performance close to using full context while reducing token usage by 50 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Talk, Judge, Cooperate: Gossip-Driven Indirect Reciprocity in Self-Interested LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07777v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indirect reciprocity, which means helping those who help others, is difficult to sustain among decentralized, self-interested LLM agents without reliable reputation systems. We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems.

| **[Capability-Based Scaling Trends for LLM-Based Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a \emph{weak-to-strong} problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the \emph{capability gap} between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 600 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these observations, we derive a \emph{jailbreaking scaling curve} that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Do We Need Adam? Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07729v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.</p></details> |  |
| **[ParisKV: Fast and Drift-Robust KV-Cache Retrieval for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07721v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>KV-cache retrieval is essential for long-context LLM inference, yet existing methods struggle with distribution drift and high latency at scale. We introduce ParisKV, a drift-robust, GPU-native KV-cache retrieval framework based on collision-based candidate selection, followed by a quantized inner-product reranking estimator. For million-token contexts, ParisKV supports CPU-offloaded KV caches via Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA), enabling on-demand top-$k$ fetching with minimal overhead. ParisKV matches or outperforms full attention quality on long-input and long-generation benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art long-context decoding efficiency: it matches or exceeds full attention speed even at batch size 1 for long contexts, delivers up to 2.8$\times$ higher throughput within full attention's runnable range, and scales to million-token contexts where full attention runs out of memory. At million-token scale, ParisKV reduces decode latency by 17$\times$ and 44$\times$ compared to MagicPIG and PQCache, respectively, two state-of-the-art KV-cache Top-$k$ retrieval baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 16 figures.
