| **[LELA: an LLM-based Entity Linking Approach with Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05192v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity linking (mapping ambiguous mentions in text to entities in a knowledge base) is a foundational step in tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question-answering, and information extraction. Our method, LELA, is a modular coarse-to-fine approach that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and works with different target domains, knowledge bases and LLMs, without any fine-tuning phase. Our experiments across various entity linking settings show that LELA is highly competitive with fine-tuned approaches, and substantially outperforms the non-fine-tuned ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimuAgent: An LLM-Based Simulink Modeling Assistant Enhanced with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05187v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[FALCONEye: Finding Answers and Localizing Content in ONE-hour-long videos with multi-modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19850v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding information in hour-long videos is a challenging task even for top-performing Vision Language Models (VLMs), as encoding visual content quickly exceeds available context windows. To tackle this challenge, we present FALCONEye, a novel video agent based on a training-free, model-agnostic meta-architecture composed of a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM). FALCONEye answers open-ended questions using an exploration-based search algorithm guided by calibrated confidence from the VLM's answers. We also introduce the FALCON-Bench benchmark, extending Question Answering problem to Video Answer Search-requiring models to return both the answer and its supporting temporal window for open-ended questions in hour-long videos. With just a 7B VLM and a lightweight LLM, FALCONEye outscores all open-source 7B VLMs and comparable agents in FALCON-Bench. It further demonstrates its generalization capability in MLVU benchmark with shorter videos and different tasks, surpassing GPT-4o on single-detail tasks while slashing inference cost by roughly an order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluative Fingerprints: Stable and Systematic Differences in LLM Evaluator Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05114v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, code and artifacts at : https://github.com/wajid-nasser/evaluative-fingerprints</p></details> |
| **[Token-Level LLM Collaboration via FusionRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05106v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-Thought Is Necessary for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a common technique for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, extended reasoning is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage. As such, a key question becomes how to optimally allocate compute to when reasoning is actually needed. We study this through confidence-gated CoT, where a model produces a direct answer and a confidence estimate to decide whether to invoke CoT. We present an evaluation framework together with the first systematic study of confidence signals for this decision. We evaluate four representative confidence measures and compare them with random gating and an oracle upper bound. Experiments across two model families and diverse reasoning tasks show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant reasoning. However, we also find that the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent across settings. Through our evaluation framework and analysis, our study provides practical guidance toward developing and evaluating models that selectively use CoT.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Talking with Tables for Better LLM Factual Data Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17189v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with requests related to information retrieval and data manipulation that frequently arise in real-world scenarios under multiple conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that leveraging tabular structures in LLM interactions, is more effective than utilizing other structures for handling prevalent requests that operate over factual data. Through comprehensive evaluations across various scenarios and request types, we show that providing tabular structures yields a 40.29\% average performance gain along with better robustness and token efficiency. Through attention-value analysis, we discover that tables help LLMs better locate relevant information, explaining these improvements. Beyond tables and text, we evaluate whether (1) blending structuredness within text, such as providing templates or fixing the order of attributes, and (2) other representative structures, such as knowledge graphs and JSON are helpful. We observe that utilizing tables offers the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The method remains robust to task complexity and adapts to unstructured sources through text-to-table conversion. Overall, we highlight the untapped potential of tabular representations for future LLM applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Is This Collection Worth My LLM's Time? Automatically Measuring Information Potential in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13691v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using five strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts, a private collection of Venetian historical records, two sets of Wikipedia articles on related topics, and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-to-Data: LLM-Driven Synthesis of Structured Network Traffic for Testbed-Free IDS Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05022v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic, large-scale, and well-labeled cybersecurity datasets are essential for training and evaluating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets suitable for IDS research. We propose a methodology that combines protocol documentation, attack semantics, and explicit statistical rules to condition LLMs without fine-tuning or access to raw samples. Using the AWID3 IEEE~802.11 benchmark as a demanding case study, we generate labeled datasets with four state-of-the-art LLMs and assess fidelity through a multi-level validation framework including global similarity metrics, per-feature distribution testing, structural comparison, and cross-domain classification. Results show that, under explicit constraints, LLM-generated datasets can closely approximate the statistical and structural characteristics of real network traffic, enabling gradient-boosting classifiers to achieve F1-scores up to 0.956 when evaluated on real samples. Overall, the findings suggest that constrained LLM-driven generation can facilitate on-demand IDS experimentation, providing a testbed-free, privacy-preserving alternative that overcomes the traditional bottlenecks of physical traffic collection and manual labeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[N-GLARE: An Non-Generative Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14195v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CurricuLLM: Designing Personalized and Workforce-Aligned Cybersecurity Curricula Using Fine-Tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04940v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, driven by increased digitalization and new cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development. CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies. We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS Through Dynamic Prompt Optimization and Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15949v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[CuMA: Aligning LLMs with Sparse Cultural Values via Demographic-Aware Mixture of Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04885v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) serve a global audience, alignment must transition from enforcing universal consensus to respecting cultural pluralism. We demonstrate that dense models, when forced to fit conflicting value distributions, suffer from \textbf{Mean Collapse}, converging to a generic average that fails to represent diverse groups. We attribute this to \textbf{Cultural Sparsity}, where gradient interference prevents dense parameters from spanning distinct cultural modes. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{\textsc{CuMA}} (\textbf{Cu}ltural \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{A}dapters), a framework that frames alignment as a \textbf{conditional capacity separation} problem. By incorporating demographic-aware routing, \textsc{CuMA} internalizes a \textit{Latent Cultural Topology} to explicitly disentangle conflicting gradients into specialized expert subspaces. Extensive evaluations on WorldValuesBench, Community Alignment, and PRISM demonstrate that \textsc{CuMA} achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both dense baselines and semantic-only MoEs. Crucially, our analysis confirms that \textsc{CuMA} effectively mitigates mean collapse, preserving cultural diversity. Our code is available at https://github.com/Throll/CuMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM + ASP Workflow for Joint Entity-Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12611v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10% of training data. It is able to achieve a 2.5 times (35% over 15%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[MPM-LLM4DSE: Reaching the Pareto Frontier in HLS with Multimodal Learning and LLM-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04801v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) seeks Pareto-optimal designs within expansive pragma configuration spaces. To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology. Code and models are available at https://github.com/wslcccc/MPM-LLM4DSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Invoice Data Extraction: Using LLM and OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05547v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low-quality scans, which are often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification. Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[IF-CRITIC: Towards a Fine-Grained LLM Critic for Instruction-Following Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01014v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-following is a fundamental ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring their generated outputs to follow multiple constraints imposed in input instructions. Numerous studies have attempted to enhance this ability through preference optimization or reinforcement learning based on reward signals from LLM-as-a-Judge. However, existing evaluation models for instruction-following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial costs and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM critic for fine-grained, efficient, and reliable instruction-following evaluation. We first develop a checklist generator to decompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance of the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a multi-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level preference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments show that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including o4-mini and Gemini-3-Pro. With the reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance gains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead compared to strong LLM critic baselines.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Differential syntactic and semantic encoding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04765v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiskAtlas: Exposing Domain-Specific Risks in LLMs through Knowledge-Graph-Guided Harmful Prompt Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04740v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining Intrinsic Rewards from LLM Hidden States for Efficient Best-of-N Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12225v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Best-of-N sampling is a powerful method for improving Large Language Model (LLM) performance, but it is often limited by its dependence on massive, text-based reward models. These models are not only computationally expensive but also data-hungry, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training. This creates a significant data challenge, as they overlook a rich, readily available data source: the LLM's own internal hidden states. To address this data and efficiency gap, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel and lightweight method that learns a reward function directly from the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states. Operating at the token embedding level, SWIFT employs simple linear layers to effectively distinguish between preferred and dispreferred generations, eliminating the need for computationally intensive text-based modeling. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms existing baselines (12.7% higher accuracy than EurusRM-7B on MATH dataset) while using less than 0.005% of their parameters. Its robust scalability, compatibility with certain closed-source models via logit access, and ability to combine with traditional reward models for additional performance highlight SWIFT's practical value and contribution to more efficient data-driven LLM post-training. Our code is available at https://github.com/aster2024/SWIFT .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2026 (Research Track).

| **[GAPO: Robust Advantage Estimation for Real-World Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21830v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods, such as GRPO, are popular due to their critic-free and normalized advantage estimation. However, in real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with unpredictable noise, leading to distorted advantage computation and increased rollout outliers. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an interval with the highest SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) per prompt and uses the median of that interval as an adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation to reduce noise further. This adaptive Q robustly handles rollout noise while remaining plug-and-play and efficient. We evaluate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a collected large dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks spanning 10 programming languages. GAPO yields up to 4.35 in-domain (ID) and 5.30 out-of-domain (OOD) exact-match improvements over GRPO and its variant DAPO, while achieving lower clipping ratios and higher GPU throughput.

| **[DSC2025 -- ViHallu Challenge: Detecting Hallucination in Vietnamese LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04711v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of large language models (LLMs) in production environments remains significantly constrained by their propensity to generate hallucinations -- fluent, plausible-sounding outputs that contradict or fabricate information. While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior-Informed Zeroth-Order Optimization with Adaptive Direction Alignment for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04710v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 12pages, 6figures |
| **[Latent Fusion Jailbreak: Blending Harmful and Harmless Representations to Elicit Unsafe LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10029v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing methods, primarily relying on discrete input optimization (e.g., GCG), often suffer from high computational costs and generate high-perplexity prompts that are easily blocked by simple filters. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a stealthy white-box attack that operates in the continuous latent space. Unlike previous approaches, LFJ constructs adversarial representations by mathematically fusing the hidden states of a harmful query with a thematically similar benign query, effectively masking malicious intent while retaining semantic drive. We further introduce a gradient-guided optimization strategy to balance attack success and computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations on Vicuna-7B, LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, Guanaco-7B, LLaMA-3-70B, and Mistral-7B-Instruct show that LFJ achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 94.01%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines like GCG and AutoDAN while avoiding detectable input artifacts. Furthermore, we identify that thematic similarity in the latent space is a critical vulnerability in current safety alignments. Finally, we propose a latent adversarial training defense that reduces LFJ's ASR by over 80% without compromising model utility.</p></details> |  |

However, as LLMs improve their problem-solving, any further improvement will potentially require high-quality solutions to difficult problems that are not available to humans. As a result, learning from unlabeled data is becoming increasingly attractive in the research community. Existing methods extract learning signal from a model's consistency, either by majority voting or by converting the model's internal confidence into reward. Although internal consistency metric such as entropy or self-certainty require no human intervention, as we show in this work, these are unreliable signals for large-scale and long-term training. To address the unreliability, we propose PRISM, a unified training framework that uses a Process Reward Model (PRM) to guide learning alongside model's internal confidence in the absence of ground-truth labels. We show that effectively combining PRM with self-certainty can lead to both stable training and better test-time performance, and also keep the model's internal confidence in check.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First version of ToolGate</p></details> |

In this context, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling natural-language interfaces for Internet of Things (IoT) control. However, existing LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable and inefficient device control due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, high inference latency and cost, and limited personalization. To address these challenges, we present IoTGPT, an LLM-based smart home agent designed to execute IoT commands in a reliable, efficient, and personalized manner. Inspired by how humans manage complex tasks, IoTGPT decomposes user instructions into subtasks and memorizes them. By reusing learned subtasks, subsequent instructions can be processed more efficiently with fewer LLM calls, improving reliability and reducing both latency and cost. IoTGPT also supports fine-grained personalization by adapting individual subtasks to user preferences. Our evaluation demonstrates that IoTGPT outperforms baselines in accuracy, latency/cost, and personalization, while reducing user workload.</p></details> |  |

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving.</p></details> |  |

Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Recent works have employed large language models (LLMs) as a text decoder to leverage their reasoning capabilities. However, prior approaches that project audio features into the LLM embedding space without considering cross-modal alignment fail to fully utilize these capabilities. To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels. We further design a Two-Stream Adapter that extracts semantically enriched audio embeddings, thereby delivering richer information to the Cross-Modal Aligner. Finally, leveraging the aligned audio embeddings, a proposed Token Guide directly computes scores within the LLM text embedding space to steer the output logits of generated captions. Experimental results confirm that our framework strengthens the reasoning capabilities of the LLM decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures; |

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 17th Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC 2025)</p></details> |

Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle</p></details> |  |

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks. The report showcases the viability of model merging for efficiently creating multi-capability LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge benchmark derived from authentic professional forum discussions, covering 7 academic and industrial domains with 430 curated tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA evaluates specialized reasoning, domain-specific terminology understanding, and contextual interpretation, and adopts a hierarchical difficulty structure to ensure semantic clarity and uniquely identifiable answers. Experiments on over multiple mainstream LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps, particularly on tasks requiring deep domain reasoning, exposing limitations overlooked by existing benchmarks. Overall, LPFQA provides an authentic and discriminative evaluation framework that complements prior benchmarks and informs future LLM development.</p></details> |  |

However, current safety measures often fail to address implicit, domain-specific risks. To investigate this gap, we introduce a dataset of 3,000 annotated queries spanning education, finance, and management. Evaluations across 14 leading LLMs reveal a concerning vulnerability: an average jailbreak success rate of 57.8%. In response, we propose MENTOR, a metacognition-driven self-evolution framework. MENTOR first performs structured self-assessment through simulated critical thinking, such as perspective-taking and consequential reasoning to uncover latent model misalignments. These reflections are formalized into dynamic rule-based knowledge graphs that evolve with emerging risk patterns. To enforce these rules at inference time, we introduce activation steering, a method that directly modulates the model's internal representations to ensure compliance. Experiments demonstrate that MENTOR substantially reduces attack success rates across all tested domains and achieves risk analysis performance comparable to human experts. Our work offers a scalable and adaptive pathway toward robust domain-specific alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions. We will release our code and curated datasets upon accepted.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic method for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[BackdoorAgent: A Unified Framework for Backdoor Attacks on LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04566v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.</p></details> |  |

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked "Why is completion rate 80%?", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.</p></details> | 39 pages, 11 tables |

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.</p></details> |  |

Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework featuring a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Grounded in Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Leveraging this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Our analysis reveals deficiencies in failure recovery and fine-grained instruction following, with performance stratification becoming evident as conversational depth increases. GPT-5 demonstrates the most sustained resilience, maintaining a 66.40% robustness score, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro by 5.59%, while other models lag behind.

| **[Exploring Similarity between Neural and LLM Trajectories in Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24307v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Retrieval: Improving Evidence Quality for LLM-based Multimodal Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03135v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing multimodal disinformation, where deceptive claims are reinforced through coordinated text and visual content, poses significant challenges to automated fact-checking. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, capitalizing on their strong reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities. Emerging retrieval-augmented frameworks further equip LLMs with access to open-domain external information, enabling evidence-based verification beyond their internal knowledge. Despite their promising gains, our empirical study reveals notable shortcomings in the external search coverage and evidence quality evaluation. To mitigate those limitations, we propose Aletheia, an end-to-end framework for automated multimodal fact-checking. It introduces a novel evidence retrieval strategy that improves evidence coverage and filters useless information from open-domain sources, enabling the extraction of high-quality evidence for verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aletheia achieves an accuracy of 88.3% on two public multimodal disinformation datasets and 90.2% on newly emerging claims. Compared with existing evidence retrieval strategies, our approach improves verification accuracy by up to 30.8%, highlighting the critical role of evidence quality in LLM-based disinformation verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Steps are Informative: On the Linearity of LLMs' RLVR Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04537v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.</p></details> | pre-print |

However, our empirical analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals substantial latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before notes receive a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified LLM-based framework that augments Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, supported by a hierarchical three-stage evaluation of relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework with HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K health notes annotated for helpfulness, and a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Our analysis first uncovers a key loophole in current crowd-sourced governance: voters frequently conflate stylistic fluency with factual accuracy. Addressing this via our hierarchical evaluation, experiments across 15 representative LLMs demonstrate that CrowdNotes+ significantly outperforms human contributors in note correctness, helpfulness, and evidence utility.</p></details> |  |

We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 13 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, Conference: Robotics, Automation, and Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.</p></details> | EACL 2026 Industry |
| **[Beyond Static Summarization: Proactive Memory Extraction for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04463v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory management is vital for LLM agents to handle long-term interaction and personalization. Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is "ahead-of-time", acting as a blind "feed-forward" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually "one-off", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.</p></details> |  |

We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[XGrammar 2: Dynamic and Efficient Structured Generation Engine for Agentic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04426v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study multi-document legal case summarization, where a single case often spans many documents totaling 100K-500K tokens. We introduce Gavel-Ref, a reference-based evaluation framework with multi-value checklist evaluation over 26 items, as well as residual fact and writing-style evaluations. Using Gavel-Ref, we go beyond the single aggregate scores reported in prior work and systematically evaluate 12 frontier LLMs on 100 legal cases ranging from 32K to 512K tokens, primarily from 2025. Our results show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieves only around 50 of $S_{\text{Gavel-Ref}}$, highlighting the difficulty of the task. Models perform well on simple checklist items (e.g., filing date) but struggle on multi-value or rare ones such as settlements and monitor reports. As LLMs continue to improve and may surpass human-written summaries -- making human references less reliable -- we develop Gavel-Agent, an efficient and autonomous agent scaffold that equips LLMs with six tools to navigate and extract checklists directly from case documents. With Qwen3, Gavel-Agent reduces token usage by 36% while resulting in only a 7% drop in $S_{\text{checklist}}$ compared to end-to-end extraction with GPT-4.1.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage at https://yao-dou.github.io/gavel/</p></details> |

Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.</p></details> | Under Review |

To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks. Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards, highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 Table, 6 Figures</p></details> |

However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies). We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements. We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, RL emerges during the inference time of large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon we term in-context RL (ICRL). To reveal this capability, we introduce a simple multi-round prompting framework, we call ICRL prompting, for inference-time self-improvement. The goal of ICRL prompting is to guide LLMs to perform reinforcement learning during inference for self-improvement on a given task. After each response, the model receives numerical scalar feedback, denoted as a reward. In the next round, we prompt the LLM again together with a context that concatenates all prior responses and their associated rewards. We consistently observe that response quality improves as the context grows. In other words, the LLM can optimize scalar reward signals during inference, exhibiting behavior analogous to reinforcement learning. We evaluate ICRL prompting on Game of 24, creative writing, ScienceWorld, and Olympiad-level math competitions (AIME and HMMT), demonstrating significant improvements over baselines such as Self-Refine and Reflexion. Notably, even when the reward signals are generated by the same LLM, ICRL prompting still improves performance, highlighting a promising new paradigm for test-time scaling.</p></details> |  |

However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fi...</summary><p>We find that the key to jailbreak the LLM is objectifying its safety responsibility, thus we delegate the open-web to inject harmful semantics and get the huge gain from unmoderated web resources</p></details> |

Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, users may need to share private information (e.g., contact details, health records). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such information, prior work introduced real-life, scenario-based benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) and found that LLMs can leak private information in complex scenarios. However, these evaluations relied on proxy LLMs to judge the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses, rather than directly measuring users' perceptions. To understand how users perceive the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study ($n=94$) using 90 PrivacyLens scenarios. We found that users had low agreement with each other when evaluating identical LLM responses. In contrast, five proxy LLMs reached high agreement, yet each proxy LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that proxy LLMs cannot accurately estimate users' wide range of perceptions of utility and privacy in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We discuss the need for more user-centered studies to measure LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy, and for improving alignment between LLMs and users in estimating perceived privacy and utility.</p></details> |  |

However, current conversational business analytics (CBA) systems often lack built-in verification mechanisms, leaving users to manually validate potentially flawed results. This paper introduces two complementary verification techniques: Q*, which performs reverse translation and semantic matching between code and user intent, and Feedback+, which incorporates execution feedback to guide code refinement. Embedded within a generator-discriminator framework, these mechanisms shift validation responsibilities from users to the system. Evaluations on three benchmark datasets, Spider, Bird, and GSM8K, demonstrate that both Q* and Feedback+ reduce error rates and task completion time. The study also identifies reverse translation as a key bottleneck, highlighting opportunities for future improvement. Overall, this work contributes a design-oriented framework for building more reliable, enterprise-grade GenAI systems capable of trustworthy decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>WITS ...</summary><p>WITS 2025 (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems 2025)</p></details> |

We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.</p></details> |  |

While prevailing research attributes failures in Video-LLMs to perceptual limitations, our empirical analysis reveals a cognitive misalignment termed Semantic Inertia, where models suppress valid visual evidence in favor of dominant language priors. To rectify this, we propose VISTA, a training-free framework designed to align perception with logical deduction. By dynamically routing inference paths and materializing implicit visual features into explicit textual anchors, our approach effectively counterbalances the influence of parametric knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate a Latent Reasoning Consensus mechanism to mitigate stochastic hallucinations. VISTA showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models. Our codebase will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a Stage 1 Registered Report.

We formalize two distinct unlearning granularities, domain-level and instance-level, and propose BiForget, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets. Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs. Ultimately, it facilitates more robust forgetting and better utility preservation, providing a more rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Unlocking the Pre-Trained Model as a Dual-Alignment Calibrator for Post-Trained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04277v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs: Analysis and Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior works have shown that fine-tuning on new knowledge can induce factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), leading to incorrect outputs when evaluated on previously known information. However, the specific manifestations of such hallucination and its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset \textit{Biography-Reasoning}, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that hallucinations not only severely affect tasks involving newly introduced knowledge, but also propagate to other evaluation tasks. Moreover, when fine-tuning on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit elevated hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the degree of unfamiliarity within a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations. Through interpretability analysis, we show that learning new knowledge weakens the model's attention to key entities in the input question, leading to an over-reliance on surrounding context and a higher risk of hallucination. Conversely, reintroducing a small amount of known knowledge during the later stages of training restores attention to key entities and substantially mitigates hallucination behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that disrupted attention patterns can propagate across lexically similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations beyond the original task.</p></details> |  |

To improve attack ability, inspired by adversarial aggregation strategies, we integrate multiple jailbreak tricks into a single developer template. Especially, we apply Adversarial Context Alignment to purge semantic inconsistencies and use NTP (a type of harmful prompt) -based few-shot examples to guide malicious outputs, lastly forming DH-CoT attack with a fake chain of thought. In experiments, we further observe that existing red-teaming datasets include samples unsuitable for evaluating attack gains, such as BPs, NHPs, and NTPs. Such data hinders accurate evaluation of true attack effect lifts. To address this, we introduce MDH, a Malicious content Detection framework integrating LLM-based annotation with Human assistance, with which we clean data and build RTA dataset suite. Experiments show that MDH reliably filters low-quality samples and that DH-CoT effectively jailbreaks models including GPT-5 and Claude-4, notably outperforming SOTA methods like H-CoT and TAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Does Loss Optimization Actually Teach, If Anything? Knowledge Dynamics in Continual Pre-training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03858v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Once Upon a Team: Investigating Bias in LLM-Driven Software Team Composition and Task Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03857v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods require access to the data being removed, exposing it to membership inference attacks and potential misuse of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We address this critical challenge by proposing Shadow Unlearning, a novel paradigm of approximate unlearning, that performs machine unlearning on anonymized forget data without exposing PII. We further propose a novel privacy-preserving framework, Neuro-Semantic Projector Unlearning (NSPU) to achieve Shadow unlearning. To evaluate our method, we compile Multi-domain Fictitious Unlearning (MuFU) forget set across five diverse domains and introduce an evaluation stack to quantify the trade-off between knowledge retention and unlearning effectiveness. Experimental results on various LLMs show that NSPU achieves superior unlearning performance, preserves model utility, and enhances user privacy. Additionally, the proposed approach is at least 10 times more computationally efficient than standard unlearning approaches. Our findings foster a new direction for privacy-aware machine unlearning that balances data protection and model fidelity.</p></details> |  |

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to similar state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Track Their Output Length? A Dynamic Feedback Mechanism for Precise Length Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01768v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precisely controlling the length of generated text is a common requirement in real-world applications. However, despite significant advancements in following human instructions, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with this task. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs often fail to accurately measure their response lengths, leading to poor adherence to length constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel length regulation approach that incorporates dynamic length feedback during generation, enabling adaptive adjustments to meet target lengths. Experiments on summarization and biography tasks show our training-free approach significantly improves precision in achieving target token, word, or sentence counts without compromising quality. Additionally, we demonstrate that further supervised fine-tuning allows our method to generalize effectively to broader text-generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Brute Force to Semantic Insight: Performance-Guided Data Transformation Design with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03808v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[InComeS: Integrating Compression and Selection Mechanisms into LLMs for Efficient Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22156v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 18 pages,5 figures |

We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03775v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.</p></details> |  |

LLM Source Preferences under Knowledge Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03746v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and code: https://github.com/JaSchuste/llm-source-preference</p></details> |

In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/ProCLIP.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 fiugres |

We observe that perturbations orthogonal to the alignment direction - defined by weight differences between aligned (safe) and unaligned models - rapidly compromise model safety. In contrast, updates along the alignment direction largely preserve it, revealing the parameter space as a "narrow safety basin". To address this, we propose AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning) to maintain safety by explicitly constraining update directions during fine-tuning. By penalizing updates orthogonal to the alignment direction, AsFT effectively constrains the model within the "narrow safety basin," thus preserving its inherent safety. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models show that AsFT reduces harmful behaviors by up to 7.60%, improves task performance by 3.44%, and consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies have employed large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive learning environments, these interactions are limited to conversational exchanges, failing to adapt to learners' individualized cognitive and psychological states. As a result, students' engagement is low and they struggle to gain inspiration. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs integrated with Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate simulates peer-like roles, infers learners' psychological states such as misunderstandings and confusion during collaborative discussions, and dynamically adjusts interaction strategies to support higher-order thinking. Comprehensive evaluations, including simulation-based experiments, human assessments, and real classroom trials, demonstrate that OnlineMate significantly promotes deep learning and cognitive engagement by elevating students' average cognitive level while substantially improving emotional engagement scores.</p></details> | work in progress |

Once MAS is induced to trust a malicious link, attackers can use it as a springboard to expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack manipulating unique structures of web links to deceive MAS. We design 12 representative attack variants that encompass various methods, such as homoglyph deception, sub-directory nesting, and parameter obfuscation. Through extensive experiments on these attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input design, lowering the threshold for attacks significantly. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks, providing new insights into MAS safety.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Implicit to Explicit: Token-Efficient Logical Supervision for Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03682v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For its rigorous assessment, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive framework that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal overhead. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STONE-watermarking-AB4B/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Compositional Generalization of LLMs via Skill Taxonomy Guided Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03676v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data for our methods and experiments are available at https://github.com/weiyifan1023/STEPS</p></details> |
