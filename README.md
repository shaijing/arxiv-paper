| **[Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the "battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically, we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of 1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Explore Briefly, Then Decide: Mitigating LLM Overthinking via Cumulative Entropy Regulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02249v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Reasoning with LLMs for k-anonymity Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09674v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Study on LLMs for Promptagator-Style Dense Retriever Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02241v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2025 short research paper</p></details> |

Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARUQULA -- An LLM based Text2SPARQL Approach using ReAct and Knowledge Graph Exploration Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02200v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL) has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the Text2SPARQL domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>peer ...</summary><p>peer reviewed publication at Text2SPARQL Workshop @ ESWC 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Disagreements Elicit Robustness: Investigating Self-Repair Capabilities under LLM Multi-Agent Disagreements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15153v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of cooperation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MAS). However, it remains unclear how disagreements shape collective decision-making. In this paper, we revisit the role of disagreement and argue that general, partially overlapping disagreements prevent premature consensus and expand the explored solution space, while disagreements on task-critical steps can derail collaboration depending on the topology of solution paths. We investigate two collaborative settings with distinct path structures: collaborative reasoning (CounterFact, MQuAKE-cf), which typically follows a single evidential chain, whereas collaborative programming (HumanEval, GAIA) often adopts multiple valid implementations. Disagreements are instantiated as general heterogeneity among agents and as task-critical counterfactual knowledge edits injected into context or parameters. Experiments reveal that general disagreements consistently improve success by encouraging complementary exploration. By contrast, task-critical disagreements substantially reduce success on single-path reasoning, yet have a limited impact on programming, where agents can choose alternative solutions. Trace analyses show that MAS frequently bypasses the edited facts in programming but rarely does so in reasoning, revealing an emergent self-repair capability that depends on solution-path rather than scale alone. Our code is available at https://github.com/wbw625/MultiAgentRobustness.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[REALM: Recursive Relevance Modeling for LLM-based Document Re-Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18379v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document re-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including ranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to token-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose REALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived relevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian updates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries, REALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while significantly reducing token usage and latency, improving NDCG@10 by 0.7-11.9 and simultaneously reducing the number of LLM inferences by 23.4-84.4%, promoting it as the next-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference, Oral). 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[LangGrasp: Leveraging Fine-Tuned LLMs for Language Interactive Robot Grasping with Ambiguous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02104v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge, we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework. The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects. Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured environments. More information and code are available here: https://github.com/wu467/LangGrasp.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Demystifying the Roles of LLM Layers in Retrieval, Knowledge, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02091v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[Break the ID-Language Barrier: An Adaption Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18262v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enhanced, Data-Driven Personalized and Equitable Clinician Scheduling: A Predict-then-Optimize Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02047v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to IEEE ICDM 2025 Workshops Proceedings; IEEE Computer Society Press</p></details> |
| **[Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05735v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Push the Limit of Multi-modal Emotion Recognition by Prompting LLMs with Receptive-Field-Aware Attention Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17674v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the emotions in a dialogue usually requires external knowledge to accurately understand the contents. As the LLMs become more and more powerful, we do not want to settle on the limited ability of the pre-trained language model. However, the LLMs either can only process text modality or are too expensive to process the multimedia information. We aim to utilize both the power of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In this paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance of a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task vanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores. These predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted probabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual understanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each sample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of LLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module. In the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with GPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B. The experiments in IEMOCAP with 4-way and 6-way settings demonstrated that the Lantern can significantly improve the performance of current vanilla models by up to 1.23% and 1.80%.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoSQL-Eval: First Evaluation of LLMs on PostGIS-Based NL2GeoSQL Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25264v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) tasks within general databases. However, extending to GeoSQL introduces additional complexity from spatial data types, function invocation, and coordinate systems, which greatly increases generation and execution difficulty. Existing benchmarks mainly target general SQL, and a systematic evaluation framework for GeoSQL is still lacking. To fill this gap, we present GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation, together with GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark for assessing LLM performance in NL2GeoSQL tasks. GeoSQL-Bench defines three task categories-conceptual understanding, syntax-level SQL generation, and schema retrieval-comprising 14,178 instances, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 thematic databases. GeoSQL-Eval is grounded in Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, covering four cognitive dimensions, five capability levels, and twenty task types to establish a comprehensive process from knowledge acquisition and syntax generation to semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. We evaluate 24 representative models across six categories and apply the entropy weight method with statistical analyses to uncover performance differences, common error patterns, and resource usage. Finally, we release a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard platform for continuous testing and global comparison. This work extends the NL2GeoSQL paradigm and provides a standardized, interpretable, and extensible framework for evaluating LLMs in spatial database contexts, offering valuable references for geospatial information science and related applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Multi-Task Bangla Hate Speech Detection: Type, Severity, and Target](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01995v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release the dataset and all related scripts.</p></details> |  |

Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

To further promote adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers. ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems, potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at github.com/davegabe/pag-llm.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a systematic methodology that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78 to 0.83.

While RLVR promises to improve reasoning by allowing models to learn from free exploration, there remains debate over whether it truly enhances reasoning abilities or simply boosts sampling efficiency. This paper systematically investigates the impact of RLVR on LLM reasoning. We revisit Pass@K experiments and demonstrate that RLVR can extend the reasoning boundary for both mathematical and coding tasks. This is supported by our introduction of a novel evaluation metric, CoT-Pass@K, which captures reasoning success by accounting for both the final answer and intermediate reasoning steps. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework explaining RLVR's incentive mechanism, demonstrating how it can encourage correct reasoning even when rewards are based solely on answer correctness. Our analysis of RLVR's training dynamics reveals that it incentivizes correct reasoning early in the process, with substantial improvements in reasoning quality confirmed through extensive evaluations.

Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[MathArena: Evaluating LLMs on Uncontaminated Math Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23281v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as CMIMC 2025, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On IMO 2025, top models achieve slightly less than 40%, demonstrating both notable progress and significant room for improvement. So far, we have evaluated over $50$ models across seven competitions, totaling $162$ problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Hoc Predictions in AutoML: Leveraging LLMs to Enhance Model Selection and Benchmarking for Tabular datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01842v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection, with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentations ADAPT Annual Scientific Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Plan Then Action:High-Level Planning Guidance Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01833v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 Tables, 9 Figures; Accepted to MathNLP 2025: The 3rd Workshop on Mathematical Natural Language Processing (co-located with EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Spam Reviews by Integrating Language Model Embeddings and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01801v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs. Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning over User Preferences: Knowledge Graph-Augmented LLMs for Explainable Conversational Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14459v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by capturing user preferences through interactive dialogues. Explainability in CRSs is crucial as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, increasing system transparency and trustworthiness. However, current CRSs often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) or language models to extract and represent user preferences as latent vectors, which limits their explainability. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities that can bridge this gap by generating human-understandable preference summaries. However, effectively reasoning over user preferences in CRSs remains challenging as LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for analyzing user preferences. While KGs provide rich domain knowledge, integrating them with LLMs encounters a significant modality gap between structured KG information and unstructured conversations. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a plug-and-play framework that synergizes LLMs and KGs to reason over user preferences, enhancing the performance and explainability of existing CRSs. COMPASS employs a two-stage training approach: first, it bridges the gap between the structured KG and natural language through novel graph entity captioning pre-training. Next, COMPASS optimizes user preference reasoning via knowledge-aware instruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user preferences from dialogue histories and KG-augmented context. This enables COMPASS to perform knowledge-aware reasoning and generate interpretable user preferences that can seamlessly integrate with existing CRS models for improving recommendation performance and explainability. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPASS in improving various CRS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |
| **[MetaFaith: Faithful Natural Language Uncertainty Expression in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24858v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

In the healthcare domain, the most common approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**, where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical pre-consultation.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.</p></details> |  |

The Buffett GuruAgent achieves the highest performance, delivering a 42.2\% CAGR that significantly outperforms benchmarks, while other agents show varied results.

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.

| **[Interactive Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26306v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/linhh29/Interactive-Learning-for-LLM-Reasoning</p></details> |

Despite its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%) without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$, which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice, all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods; e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present $\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited exploration.</p></details> | Preprint |

These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.</p></details> |  |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

However, in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task: detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework, which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios, demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic data techniques offer a potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types (rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data \textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets. Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good" ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data. Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than ~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse" during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional benefits, and offers practical guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Main Conference paper at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.</p></details> |  |

However, extracting insights from repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots support natural language interactions with repositories, chatbots struggle to understand questions beyond their trained intents and to accurately retrieve the relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We use a two-step approach: constructing a knowledge graph from repository data, and synergizing the knowledge graph with an LLM to handle natural language questions and answers. We curated 150 questions of varying complexity and evaluated the approach on five popular open-source projects. Our initial results revealed the limitations of the approach, with most errors due to the reasoning ability of the LLM. We therefore applied few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which improved accuracy to 84%. We also compared against baselines (MSRBot and GPT-4o-search-preview), and our approach performed significantly better. In a task-based user study with 20 participants, users completed more tasks correctly and in less time with our approach, and they reported that it was useful. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs and knowledge graphs are a viable solution for making repository data accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology for review</p></details> |

We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training.

In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

| **[POLAR: Automating Cyber Threat Prioritization through LLM-Powered Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01552v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 25 pages |

This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01530v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Round-trip Reinforcement Learning: Self-Consistent Training for Better Chemical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01527v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Beyond Majority Voting: LLM Aggregation by Leveraging Higher-Order Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01499v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning, how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally, failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions, leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust multi-agent LLM pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning LLMs with variational Bayesian last layer for high-dimensional Bayesian optimzation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01471v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g., categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the real-world molecular optimization tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster LLM Inference using DBMS-Inspired Preemption and Cache Replacement Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07447v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used world-wide from daily tasks to agentic systems and data analytics, requiring significant GPU resources. LLM inference systems, however, are slow compared to database systems, and inference performance and mechanism have been often regarded as a black box, limiting the expansion of the use of LLMs inside databases and other performance-critical applications. This paper first analyzes the LLM inference performance and focuses on a data management issue inside LLM inference. We find that inference systems lack an adequate resource cost model and optimization strategy to schedule requests with their intermediate results in a cache reside in GPU memory when executing multiple concurrent inference requests. We adapt classic database techniques by building cost models for concurrent inference requests and a new cache replacement policy tailored for LLM inference, which can substantially save GPU costs.</p></details> |  |

We present BIOVERSE (Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning, compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tale of LLMs and Induced Small Proxies: Scalable Agents for Knowledge Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01427v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01379v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p></details> |  |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

This paper proposes a clinical decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories. The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the system's technical components, including representation representation alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and alignment with established practices.</p></details> |  |

Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics. We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> | Camera-ready |

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., ``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities''). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>82 pa...</summary><p>82 pages, 26 figures, 34 tables.

However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Curriculum Learning for Efficient LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01135v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts. Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Thinking Tokens: LLMs as Improvement Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01123v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length, token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier, e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency. Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Augmenting LLMs for General Time Series Understanding and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01111v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14285v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference standard paper</p></details> |
| **[Safety Instincts: LLMs Learn to Trust Their Internal Compass for Self-Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01088v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM-Assisted Blue Teaming via Standardized Threat Hunting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23571v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Vulnerabilities of LLM-Assisted Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23573v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.</p></details> |  |

A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1, specificity, FAR, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Ambiguity in LLMs is a concept missing problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, title updated</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 Figures |
| **[Meaningless Tokens, Meaningful Gains: How Activation Shifts Enhance LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01032v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.</p></details> |  |

The rapid advancement of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations. Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepi...</summary><p>Prepint, under review for NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recent large language model (LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i) parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii) LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.</p></details> |  |

Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to knowledge based systems</p></details> |

Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Findings 2025, 12 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

This work introduces Opal, a modular framework that connects performance analytics insights with the vast body of published by guiding LLMs to generate informed, trustworthy optimizations.

We evaluate Opal across 1640 experiments on real-world GPU kernels and find that in over 98.5% of cases, even a single insight source yields speedups, ranging on average from 19.34% to 52.3%. Our prompt template produced correct code in all but one case, where a vague diagnostic caused an unsafe suggestion.

| **[Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25448v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiskPO: Risk-based Policy Optimization via Verifiable Reward for LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00911v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however, prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically, RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Research in this area has typically framed the task as monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices, and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Automated Ethical Profiling in SE: a Zero-Shot Evaluation of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00881v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software engineering (SE) tools for tasks that extend beyond code synthesis, including judgment under uncertainty and reasoning in ethically significant contexts. We present a fully automated framework for assessing ethical reasoning capabilities across 16 LLMs in a zero-shot setting, using 30 real-world ethically charged scenarios. Each model is prompted to identify the most applicable ethical theory to an action, assess its moral acceptability, and explain the reasoning behind their choice. Responses are compared against expert ethicists' choices using inter-model agreement metrics. Our results show that LLMs achieve an average Theory Consistency Rate (TCR) of 73.3% and Binary Agreement Rate (BAR) on moral acceptability of 86.7%, with interpretable divergences concentrated in ethically ambiguous cases. A qualitative analysis of free-text explanations reveals strong conceptual convergence across models despite surface-level lexical diversity. These findings support the potential viability of LLMs as ethical inference engines within SE pipelines, enabling scalable, auditable, and adaptive integration of user-aligned ethical reasoning. Our focus is the Ethical Interpreter component of a broader profiling pipeline: we evaluate whether current LLMs exhibit sufficient interpretive stability and theory-consistent reasoning to support automated profiling.</p></details> | Accepted at ASE 2025 |

While GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: first, the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; second, GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the assumption that no weights are clipped. Leveraging this bound, we design post-training quantization methods that avoid clipping, and outperform the original GPTQ. In addition, we provide efficient GPU inference kernels for the resulting representation. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on a firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erase to Improve: Erasable Reinforcement Learning for Search-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00861v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited. This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors, where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain. This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ManagerBench: Evaluating the Safety-Pragmatism Trade-off in Autonomous LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00857v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical. Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

While open-source evaluation tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation. We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECIR ...</summary><p>ECIR 2025 demo format</p></details> |
| **[Learning Compact Representations of LLM Abilities via Item Response Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00844v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models (LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics, we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.</p></details> |  |
