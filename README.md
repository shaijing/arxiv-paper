| **[Measuring Mid-2025 LLM-Assistance on Novice Performance in Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16703v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a "typical" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16699v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for Economic Decision-Making by LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18825v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop evaluation methods for measuring the economic decision-making capabilities and tendencies of LLMs. First, we develop benchmarks derived from key problems in economics -- procurement, scheduling, and pricing -- that test an LLM's ability to learn from the environment in context. Second, we develop the framework of litmus tests, evaluations that quantify an LLM's choice behavior on a stylized decision-making task with multiple conflicting objectives. Each litmus test outputs a litmus score, which quantifies an LLM's tradeoff response, a reliability score, which measures the coherence of an LLM's choice behavior, and a competency score, which measures an LLM's capability at the same task when the conflicting objectives are replaced by a single, well-specified objective. Evaluating a broad array of frontier LLMs, we (1) investigate changes in LLM capabilities and tendencies over time, (2) derive economically meaningful insights from the LLMs' choice behavior and chain-of-thought, (3) validate our litmus test framework by testing self-consistency, robustness, and generalizability. Overall, this work provides a foundation for evaluating LLM agents as they are further integrated into economic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 wa...</summary><p>v3 was a major revision with updated experiments and analysis; v4 consists of minor edits</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Collective Behaviour of Hundreds of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16662v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous agents powered by LLM are increasingly deployed in society, understanding their collective behaviour in social dilemmas becomes critical. We introduce an evaluation framework where LLMs generate strategies encoded as algorithms, enabling inspection prior to deployment and scaling to populations of hundreds of agents -- substantially larger than in previous work. We find that more recent models tend to produce worse societal outcomes compared to older models when agents prioritise individual gain over collective benefits. Using cultural evolution to model user selection of agents, our simulations reveal a significant risk of convergence to poor societal equilibria, particularly when the relative benefit of cooperation diminishes and population sizes increase. We release our code as an evaluation suite for developers to assess the emergent collective behaviour of their models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Align Once, Benefit Multilingually: Enforcing Multilingual Consistency for LLM Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16660v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Distribution Gap in Adversarial Training for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15238v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who can we trust? LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16610v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowPrefill: Decoupling Preemption from Prefill Scheduling Granularity to Mitigate Head-of-Line Blocking in LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16603v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) requires serving systems to handle many concurrent requests with diverse service level objectives (SLOs). This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Validating Formal Specifications with LLM-generated Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23350v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications. Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not. Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses on the state-of-the-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supercharging Agenda Setting Research: The ParlaCAP Dataset of 28 European Parliaments and a Scalable Multilingual LLM-Based Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16516v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Boundary Point Jailbreaking of Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15001v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoeTone: A Framework for Constrained Generation of Structured Chinese Songci with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02515v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across 4 families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-based, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a scoring function for best-of-N selection, we fine-tune 3 lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intra-Fairness Dynamics: The Bias Spillover Effect in Targeted LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16438v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the BiAlign CHI Workshop 2026</p></details> |

Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fabia...</summary><p>Fabian P.

| **[Helpful to a Fault: Measuring Illicit Assistance in Multi-Turn, Multilingual LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16346v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trojan Example: Jailbreaking LLMs through Template Filling and Unsafety Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21190v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to computing infrastructure, safety alignment serves as the primary security control preventing the generation of harmful payloads. However, this defense remains brittle. Existing jailbreak attacks typically bifurcate into white-box methods, which are inapplicable to commercial APIs due to lack of gradient access, and black-box optimization techniques, which often yield unnatural (e.g., syntactically rigid) or non-transferable (e.g., lacking cross-model generalization) prompts. In this work, we introduce TrojFill, a black-box exploitation framework that bypasses safety filters by targeting a fundamental logic flaw in current alignment paradigms: the decoupling of unsafety reasoning from content generation. TrojFill structurally reframes malicious instructions as a template-filling task required for safety analysis. By embedding obfuscated payloads (e.g., via placeholder substitution) into a "Trojan" structure, the attack induces the model to generate prohibited content as a "demonstrative example" ostensibly required for a subsequent sentence-by-sentence safety critique. This approach effectively masks the malicious intent from standard intent classifiers. We evaluate TrojFill against representative commercial systems, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, DeepSeek-3.1, and Qwen-Max. Our results demonstrate that TrojFill achieves near-universal bypass rates: reaching 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1, and 97% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing black-box baselines. Furthermore, unlike optimization-based adversarial prompts, TrojFill generates highly interpretable and transferable attack vectors, exposing a systematic vulnerability inaligned LLMs.</p></details> | under review |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automated security tasks, their effectiveness in detecting malicious packages and indicators remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs for detecting malicious software packages. Using a curated dataset of 4,070 packages (3,700 benign and 370 malicious), we evaluate model performance across two tasks: binary classification (package detection) and multi-label classification (identification of specific malicious indicators). We further investigate the impact of prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model specifications on detection accuracy. We find a significant "granularity gap" in LLMs' capabilities. While GPT-4.1 achieves near-perfect performance in binary detection (F1 $\approx$ 0.99), performance degrades by approximately 41\% when the task shifts to identifying specific malicious indicators. We observe that general models are best for filtering out the majority of threats, while specialized coder models are better at detecting attacks that follow a strict, predictable code structure. Our correlation analysis indicates that parameter size and context width have negligible explanatory power regarding detection accuracy. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful detectors at the package level, they lack the semantic depth required for precise identification at the granular indicator level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Scalable Verifiable Reward: Proxy State-Based Evaluation for Multi-turn Tool-Calling LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16246v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolicyPad: Collaborative Prototyping of LLM Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19680v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs gain adoption in high-stakes domains like mental health, domain experts are increasingly consulted to provide input into policies governing their behavior. From an observation of 19 policymaking workshops with 9 experts over 15 weeks, we identified opportunities to better support rapid experimentation, feedback, and iteration for collaborative policy design processes. We present PolicyPad, an interactive system that facilitates the emerging practice of LLM policy prototyping by drawing from established UX prototyping practices, including heuristic evaluation and storyboarding. Using PolicyPad, policy designers can collaborate on drafting a policy in real time while independently testing policy-informed model behavior with usage scenarios. We evaluate PolicyPad through workshops with 8 groups of 22 domain experts in mental health and law, finding that PolicyPad enhanced collaborative dynamics during policy design, enabled tight feedback loops, and led to novel policy contributions. Overall, our work paves expert-informed paths for advancing AI alignment and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>CHI 2...</summary><p>CHI 2026 paper.

In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present Campaign-2-PT-RAG, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user-campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign-PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78-90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo and author names</p></details> |

However, most LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited for first and second-year beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether controllable generation techniques can adapt LLM outputs to better support beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while prompting alone fails, controllable generation techniques can successfully improve output comprehensibility for beginner speakers (from 39.4% to 83.3%). We further introduce a new token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |
| **[CaveAgent: Transforming LLMs into Stateful Runtime Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01569v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms that struggle with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. We present CaveAgent, a framework that shifts tool use from ``LLM-as-Text-Generator'' to ``LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.'' CaveAgent introduces a dual-stream architecture that inverts the conventional paradigm: rather than treating the LLM's text context as the primary workspace with tools as auxiliary, CaveAgent elevates the persistent Python runtime as the central locus of state, with a lightweight semantic stream serving as its orchestrator. Beyond leveraging code generation to resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, CaveAgent introduces \textit{Stateful Runtime Management}: it injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns, unlike existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound. CaveAgent further provides a runtime-integrated skill management system that extends the Agent Skills open standard, enabling ecosystem interoperability through executable skill injections. This persistence mechanism serves as a high-fidelity external memory that reduces context drift in multi-turn interactions and preserves processed data for downstream applications without information loss. Evaluations show consistent improvement across challenging benchmarks, enabling CaveAgent to handle data scales that cause context overflow in both JSON-based and code-based agents.

Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance, and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate the LLM's safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.

| **[LLMs Exhibit Significantly Lower Uncertainty in Creative Writing Than Professional Writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16162v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that uncertainty is a key and understudied limitation of LLMs' performance in creative writing, which is often characterized as trite and cliché-ridden. Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the "uncertainty gap" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.</p></details> | 11 tables |

We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function Clustering for LLM-based Agent System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16131v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents to solve complex tasks such as question answering (QA), scientific debate, and software development. A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentNoiseBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Tool-Using LLM Agents Under Noisy Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11348v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm-Based Pipeline for Reliable and Intent-Preserving Code Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16106v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation, the automatic conversion of programs between languages, is a growing use case for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Intent-Based Privacy-Aware Orchestration Across the Cloud-Edge Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16100v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), efficiently serving LLM inference under limited GPU resources has become a critical challenge. Recently, an increasing number of studies have explored applying serverless computing paradigms to LLM serving in order to maximize resource utilization. However, LLM inference workloads are highly diverse, and modern GPU clusters are inherently heterogeneous, making it necessary to dynamically adjust deployment configurations online to better adapt to the elastic and dynamic nature of serverless environments. At the same time, enabling such online reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the stateful nature of LLM inference and the massive size of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pipeline reconfiguration approach that enables online adjustment of pipeline configurations while minimizing service downtime and performance degradation. Our method allows the system to select the optimal pipeline configuration in response to changing workloads. Experimental results on heterogeneous GPU platforms, including NVIDIA A100 and L40s, demonstrate that our migration mechanism incurs less than 50 ms of service downtime, while introducing under 10% overhead on both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT).</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Training Re-evaluation Curves Enables Effective Data Curriculums for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25380v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the *training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of *when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be *predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **["Someone Hid It": Query-Agnostic Black-Box Attacks on LLM-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00364v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been serving as effective backbones for retrieval systems, including Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation (RAG), Dense Information Retriever (IR), and Agent Memory Retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated that such LLM-based Retrieval (LLMR) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which manipulates documents by token-level injections and enables adversaries to either boost or diminish these documents in retrieval tasks. However, existing attack studies mainly (1) presume a known query is given to the attacker, and (2) highly rely on access to the victim model's parameters or interactions, which are hardly accessible in real-world scenarios, leading to limited validity. To further explore the secure risks of LLMR, we propose a practical black-box attack method that generates transferable injection tokens based on zero-shot surrogate LLMs without need of victim queries or victim models knowledge. The effectiveness of our attack raises such a robustness issue that similar effects may arise from benign or unintended document edits in the real world. To achieve our attack, we first establish a theoretical framework of LLMR and empirically verify it. Under the framework, we simulate the transferable attack as a min-max problem, and propose an adversarial learning mechanism that finds optimal adversarial tokens with learnable query samples. Our attack is validated to be effective on benchmark datasets across popular LLM retrievers.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAA: Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation for Accelerating LLM Prefill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16054v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[How Uncertain Is the Grade? A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16039v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeDecider: An LLM-Based Framework for Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16034v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated cross-domain recommendation (Federated CDR) aims to collaboratively learn personalized recommendation models across heterogeneous domains while preserving data privacy. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based recommendation models have demonstrated impressive performance by leveraging LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge. However, adopting LLM-based recommendation models in Federated CDR scenarios introduces new challenges. First, there exists a risk of overfitting with domain-specific local adapters. The magnitudes of locally optimized parameter updates often vary across domains, causing biased aggregation and overfitting toward domain-specific distributions. Second, unlike traditional recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, bipartite graph-based methods) that learn explicit and comparable user/item representations, LLMs encode knowledge implicitly through autoregressive text generation training. This poses additional challenges for effectively measuring the cross-domain similarities under heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based framework for federated cross-domain recommendation, FeDecider. Specifically, FeDecider tackles the challenge of scale-specific noise by disentangling each client's low-rank updates and sharing only their directional components. To handle the need for flexible and effective integration, each client further learns personalized weights that achieve the data-aware integration of updates from other domains. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FeDecider.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |
| **[ReLoop: Structured Modeling and Behavioral Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15983v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can translate natural language into optimization code, but silent failures pose a critical risk: code that executes and returns solver-feasible solutions may encode semantically incorrect formulations, creating a feasibility-correctness gap of up to 90 percentage points on compositional problems. We introduce ReLoop, addressing silent failures from two complementary directions. Structured generation decomposes code production into a four-stage reasoning chain (understand, formalize, synthesize, verify) that mirrors expert modeling practice, with explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to prevent formulation errors at their source. Behavioral verification detects errors that survive generation by testing whether the formulation responds correctly to solver-based parameter perturbation, without requiring ground truth -- an external semantic signal that bypasses the self-consistency problem inherent in LLM-based code review. The two mechanisms are complementary: structured generation dominates on complex compositional problems, while behavioral verification becomes the largest single contributor on problems with localized formulation defects. Together with execution recovery via IIS-enhanced diagnostics, ReLoop raises correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution from 72.1% to 100.0% on the strongest model, with consistent gains across five models spanning three paradigms (foundation, SFT, RL) and three benchmarks. We additionally release RetailOpt-190, 190 compositional retail optimization scenarios targeting the multi-constraint interactions where LLMs most frequently fail.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and benchmark: \url{https://github.com/junbolian/ReLoop}</p></details> |
| **[CrispEdit: Low-Curvature Projections for Scalable Non-Destructive LLM Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15823v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.</p></details> |  |
| **[This human study did not involve human subjects: Validating LLM simulations as behavioral evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15785v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study.</p></details> |  |

We introduce *-PLUIE, task specific prompting variants of ParaPLUIE and evaluate their alignment with human judgement. Our experiments show that personalised *-PLUIE achieves stronger correlations with human ratings while maintaining low computational cost.</p></details> | Under review |

While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.</p></details> |  |

In UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, jointly optimizing the data collection schedule and UAV velocity is essential to minimize the average Age of Information (AoI) for sensory data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used for this optimization, but its limitations-including low sampling efficiency, discrepancies between simulation and real-world conditions, and complex training make it unsuitable for time-critical applications such as wildfire monitoring. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation using natural language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. This paper proposes a novel online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the data collection schedule and UAV velocity along the trajectory in real time, thereby asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across all ground sensors. Unlike DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and velocities using natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of FRSICL compared to state-of-the-art baselines, namely Proximal Policy Optimization, Block Coordinate Descent, and Nearest Neighbor.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker. We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aeon: High-Performance Neuro-Symbolic Memory Management for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15311v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings, failing to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions. This paper presents Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). This architecture introduces three advances: (1) Symmetric INT8 Scalar Quantization, achieving 3.1x spatial compression and 5.6x math acceleration via NEON SDOT intrinsics; (2) a decoupled Write-Ahead Log (WAL) ensuring crash-recoverability with statistically negligible overhead (<1%); and (3) a Sidecar Blob Arena eliminating the prior 440-character text ceiling via an append-only mmap-backed blob file with generational garbage collection. The Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB) exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-5us retrieval latencies, with INT8 vectors dequantized to FP32 on cache insertion to preserve L1-resident lookup performance. Benchmarks on Apple M4 Max demonstrate that the combined architecture achieves 4.70ns INT8 dot product latency, 3.09us tree traversal at 100K nodes (3.4x over FP32), and P99 read latency of 750ns under hostile 16-thread contention via epoch-based reclamation.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: P...</summary><p>v3: Production hardening.

| **[Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities and highlighting the potential for safer and more collaborative agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

This raises a fundamental question: Do LLMs even know how big these numbers are? We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities.

We investigate feedback timing and verbosity from agentic LLM-based in-car assistants through a controlled, mixed-methods study (N=45) comparing planned steps and intermediate results feedback against silent operation with final-only response. Using a dual-task paradigm with an in-car voice assistant, we found that intermediate feedback significantly improved perceived speed, trust, and user experience while reducing task load - effects that held across varying task complexities and interaction contexts. Interviews further revealed user preferences for an adaptive approach: high initial transparency to establish trust, followed by progressively reducing verbosity as systems prove reliable, with adjustments based on task stakes and situational context. We translate our empirical findings into design implications for feedback timing and verbosity in agentic assistants, balancing transparency and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (conditionally) at CHI 2026</p></details> |

Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, contextual awareness, and uncertainty handling. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR. INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR. INFO achieves a HealthBench Hard score of 0.68, outperforming leading frontier LLMs including the GPT-5 model family (GPT-5: 0.46, GPT-5.2: 0.42, GPT-5.1: 0.40), Grok 3 (0.23), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.19), and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (0.02) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence and Pathway.md, now DoxGPT by Doximity), it maintains a performance lead with a HealthBench Hard score of 0.72. These results highlight the strengths of DR. INFO in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and response completeness. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, two graphs |

Although prefix LLMs can better exploit historical context via bidirectional attention on prefix tokens, they are rarely used in practice because multi-turn training requires many duplicated triplets, and its bidirectional prefix prevents KV-cache reuse at inference time, driving up high cost and latency. To retain the contextual understanding of prefix mask while preserving the inference-time efficiency of causal mask, we introduce Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM), a masking scheme that injects sparse bidirectional attention into the causal backbone. ISM alternates bidirectional attention over query segments with unidirectional attention over answer segments, enabling the synthesis of in-context while preserving global causality. This design eliminates triplet expansion during training and maintains KV-cache reuse during inference, yielding latency comparable to standard causal LLMs. ISM is architecture-agnostic and parameter-free, adding only minimal latency. Across extensive evaluations, ISM outperforms causal baselines not only on multi-turn dialogue, but also on context-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of the Memory Barrier: A Highly Memory Efficient Training System for LLMs with Million-Token Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02108v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) on long contexts is severely constrained by prohibitive GPU memory overhead, not training time. The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/OOMB.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-as-Judge on a Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15481v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? % We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation. % Experiments on \emph{Summarize-From-Feedback} and \emph{HelpSteer2} demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms uniform allocation, reducing worst-case estimation error while maintaining identical budgets. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient LLM evaluation with practical implications for AI safety, model alignment, and automated assessment at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Agents We Trust, but Who Do Agents Trust? Latent Source Preferences Steer LLM Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15456v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as interfaces to information on online platforms. These agents filter, prioritize, and synthesize information retrieved from the platforms' back-end databases or via web search. In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

We address this problem in a large collection of Finnish World War II Karelian evacuee family interviews. Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly. We develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is). We annotate a gold-standard set to allow for a reliable evaluation, and then test whether large language models can apply the same schema at scale. Using a simple voting approach across multiple model runs, we find that an open-weight LLM can closely match expert judgments. Finally, we apply the method to label the 350K entities, producing a structured resource for downstream studies of social integration and related outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at: The 10th Joint SIGHUM Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature; EACL 2026 Workshop</p></details> |

This study explores students perceptions of these tools, particularly in terms of usability, efficiency, and how they fit into English test preparation practices. Using a mixed-methods design, we collected survey data from 140 university students across various academic fields and conducted in-depth interviews with 20 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were applied to assess differences in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and overall tool preference. The qualitative results reveal that students strategically alternate between GPT and Google based on task requirements. Google is primarily used for accessing reliable, multi-source information and verifying rules, whereas GPT is favored for summarizing content, providing explanations, paraphrasing, and drafting responses for English test tasks. Since neither tool independently satisfies all aspects of English language test preparation, students expressed a clear preference for an integrated approach. In response, this study proposes a prototype chatbot embedded within a search interface, combining GPTs interactive capabilities with Googles credibility to enhance test preparation and reduce cognitive load.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2510.17726 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Improving LLM Reliability through Hybrid Abstention and Adaptive Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15391v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

The theoretical framework is based on an ontological triad distinguishing three regulatory instances: the apprehension of the phenomenal regularities of the referential world, the structuring of embodied cognition, and the structural-linguistic sedimentation of the utterance within a socio-historical context. LDMs, operating on the product of these three instances (the document), model the discursive projection of a portion of human experience reified by the learning corpus. The proposed program aims to replace the ''fascination/fear'' dichotomy with public trials and procedures that make the place, uses, and limits of artificial discursive agents in contemporary social space decipherable, situating this approach within a perspective of governance and co-regulation involving the State, industry, civil society, and academia.</p></details> | in French language |

Therefore, verifying whether the generated assertions effectively cover the functional specifications and designing feedback mechanisms based on this coverage remain significant hurdles. To address these limitations, this paper introduces CoverAssert, a novel iterative framework for optimizing SVA generation with LLMs. The core contribution is a lightweight mechanism for matching generated assertions with specific functional descriptions in the specifications. CoverAssert achieves this by clustering the joint representations of semantic features of LLM-generated assertions and structural features extracted from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) about signals related to assertions, and then mapping them back to the specifications to analyze functional coverage quality. Leveraging this capability, CoverAssert constructs a feedback loop based on functional coverage to guide LLMs in prioritizing uncovered functional points, thereby iteratively improving assertion quality. Experimental evaluations on four open-source designs demonstrate that integrating CoverAssert with state-of-the-art generators, AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion, achieves average improvements of 9.57 % in branch coverage, 9.64 % in statement coverage, and 15.69 % in toggle coverage.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set. Code and data-generation scripts are released to support reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

We present a human- AI study evaluating three widely used LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and Claude) on 10 undergraduate-level digital logic questions spanning non-standard counters, JK-based state transitions, timing diagrams, frequency division, and finite-state machines. Twenty-four students performed pairwise model comparisons, providing per-question judgments on (i) preferred model, (ii) perceived correctness, (iii) consistency, (iv) verbosity, and (v) confidence, along with global ratings of overall model quality, satisfaction across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy and clarity), and perceived mental effort required to verify answers. To benchmark technical validity, we applied an independent judge-based evaluation against official solutions for all ten questions, using strict correctness criteria. Results reveal a consistent gap between perceived helpfulness and formal correctness: for the most sequentially demanding problems (Q1- Q7), none of the evaluated LLMs matched the official answers, despite producing confident, well-structured explanations that students often rated favorably. Error analysis indicates that models frequently default to canonical textbook templates (e.g., standard ripple counters) and struggle to translate circuit structure into exact state evolution and timing behavior. These findings suggest that, without verification scaffolds, LLMs may be unreliable for core digital logic topics and can inadvertently reinforce misconceptions in undergraduate instruction.</p></details> |  |

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://deepignorance.ai/</p></details> |

The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages , 6 figures |

While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.9 on LoCoMo and 91.6 on LongMemEval-S using GPT-4.1-mini.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This task is challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable. Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods: \faGithub \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/InfoQA}{InfoQA}.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, ICLR 2026.

We introduce ScrapeGraphAI-100k, a large-scale dataset comprising real-world LLM extraction events, collected via opt-in ScrapeGraphAI telemetry during Q2 and Q3 of 2025. Starting from 9M events, we deduplicate and balance by schema to produce 93,695 examples spanning diverse domains and languages. Each instance includes Markdown content, a prompt, a JSON schema, the LLM response, and complexity/validation metadata. We characterize the datasets structural diversity and its failure modes as schema complexity increases. We also provide a fine-tuning experiment showing that a small language model (1.7B) trained on a subset narrows the gap to larger baselines (30B), underscoring the datasets utility for efficient extraction. ScrapeGraphAI-100k enables fine-tuning small models, benchmarking structured extraction, and studying schema induction for web IR indexing, and is publicly available on HuggingFace.</p></details> |  |

A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15173v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p></details> | AAMAS'26 |

We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization.

Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhyScensis: Physics-Augmented LLM Agents for Complex Physical Scene Arrangement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14968v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Sparse MeZO: Less Parameters for Better Performance in Zeroth-Order LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15751v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks often yields impressive results, it comes at the cost of memory inefficiency due to back-propagation in gradient-based training. Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) optimizers, recently proposed to address this issue, only require forward passes during training, making them more memory-friendly. However, compared with exact gradients, ZO-based gradients usually exhibit an estimation error, which can significantly hurt the optimization process, leading to slower convergence and suboptimal solutions. In addition, we find that the estimation error will hurt more when adding to large weights instead of small weights. Based on this observation, this paper introduces Sparse MeZO, a novel memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization approach that applies ZO only to a carefully chosen subset of parameters. We propose a simple yet effective parameter selection scheme that yields significant performance gains with Sparse-MeZO. Additionally, we develop a memory-optimized implementation for sparse masking, ensuring the algorithm requires only inference-level memory consumption, allowing Sparse-MeZO to fine-tune LLaMA-30b on a single A100 GPU. Experimental results illustrate that Sparse-MeZO consistently improves both performance and convergence speed over MeZO without any overhead. For example, it achieves a 9\% absolute accuracy improvement and 3.5x speedup over MeZO on the RTE task.

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the "A+" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the "Contextual Tunneling" problem. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs), combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graph, which construct and update memory model automatically by LLM itself. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyper-edges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle traversal, beam search and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks: TriviaQA, HotpotQA, DiaASQ and demonstrate that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at LREC 2026</p></details> |

Here we use cognitive network science to reconstruct group mindsets as behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs). In this case, nodes are cue words and free associations, edges are empirical associative links, and each concept is annotated with perceived valence. We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) "digital twins" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods ("frames") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.</p></details> |  |

However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

However, existing studies question whether LLMs provide genuine benefits, often reporting comparable performance without LLMs. We show that such conclusions stem from limited evaluation settings and do not hold at scale. We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization. Pre-alignment outperforming post-alignment in over 90\% of tasks. Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design. We release our code at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLM4TSF.</p></details> |  |

While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a standard approach, it typically treats tuning tasks independently and provides limited insight into its decisions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to incorporate structured prior knowledge and reasoning into optimization pipelines. We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects. This design enables context-aware and stable hyperparameter refinement while exposing the reasoning behind optimization decisions. Experiments on a multivariate time series forecasting benchmark demonstrate that LLM-AutoOpt achieves improved predictive performance and more interpretable optimization behavior compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary System Prompt Learning can Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14697v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry. Finally, we discuss implications for the ability of behavioral tasks to uncover hidden cognitive states.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages including references, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We use this resource to benchmark several large language models on tokenization parity, topic classification, and machine translation. Our analysis reveals that Piedmontese incurs a tokenization penalty relative to higher-resource Romance languages, yet LLMs achieve classification performance approaching that of Italian, French, and English. Machine translation results are asymmetric: models translate adequately from Piedmontese into high-resource languages, but generation into Piedmontese remains challenging.

While providing a new dimension for prompt-adaptive safety evaluation, quantifying time-to-unsafe-sampling is challenging: unsafe outputs are often rare in well-aligned models and thus may not be observed under any feasible sampling budget. To address this challenge, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis. We build on recent developments in conformal prediction and propose a novel calibration technique to construct a lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt with rigorous coverage guarantees. Our key technical innovation is an optimized sampling-budget allocation scheme that improves sample efficiency while maintaining distribution-free guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods predominantly adapt video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps for temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' pre-trained semantic understanding capabilities due to the uninformative nature of timestamp outputs. In this work, we explore a timestamp-free, semantic-oriented framework that fine-tunes video LLMs using two generative learning tasks and one discriminative learning task. We first introduce a structural token generation task that enables the video LLM to recognize the temporal structure of input videos based on the input query. Through this task, the video LLM generates a sequence of special tokens, called structural tokens, which partition the video into consecutive segments and categorize them as either target events or background transitions. To enhance precise recognition of event segments, we further propose a query-focused captioning task that enables the video LLM to extract fine-grained event semantics that can be effectively utilized by the structural tokens. Finally, we introduce a structural token grounding module driven by contrastive learning to associate each structural token with its corresponding video segment, achieving holistic temporal segmentation of the input video and readily yielding the target event segments for localization. Extensive experiments across diverse temporal localization tasks demonstrate that our proposed framework, MeCo, consistently outperforms methods relying on boundary timestamp generation, highlighting the potential of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs \footnote{Code available at https://github.com/pangzss/MeCo.</p></details> | ICLR2026 |

However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Translation: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs in Sinhala and Tamil](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14517v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning in English, but whether these capabilities reflect genuine multilingual reasoning or reliance on translation-based processing in low-resource languages like Sinhala and Tamil remains unclear. We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multi-round LLM Inference over Disaggregated Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14516v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-round workflows, such as autonomous agents and iterative retrieval, have become increasingly prevalent. However, this raises hurdles for serving LLMs under prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation, a widely adopted paradigm that separates the compute-bound prefill phase and memory-bound decode phase onto individual resources. Specifically, existing systems overlook the interleaved prefill-decode workload pattern in multi-round inference, leading to sub-optimal handling of the incremental prefill workloads and model deployment for the two phases. In this work, we present AMPD, a brand new disaggregated serving framework for multi-round LLM inference. The core of AMPD is to coordinate the prefill workloads based on real-time workloads by adaptively determining where to carry out these workloads and how they are scheduled, in order to maximize service level objective (SLO) attainment. In addition, we tailor a planning algorithm for our scenario, facilitating the deduction of optimal resource allocation and parallel strategies for the two phases. Empirical results demonstrate that AMPD substantially improves SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Mixture of Space Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14490v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[When Attention Collapses: How Degenerate Layers in LLMs Enable Smaller, Stronger Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08634v4)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their performance, but we uncover a significant structural inefficiency: a phenomenon we term attention collapse. In many pre-trained decoder-style LLMs, the attention matrices in deeper layers degenerate, collapsing to near rank-one structures. These underutilized layers, which we call lazy layers, are redundant and impair model efficiency. To address this, we introduce Inheritune, a simple yet powerful training recipe designed to build smaller, stronger language models. Inheritune initializes a compact model by inheriting the potent early layers from a larger pre-trained model and then progressively trains and expands it. Our experiments on various models, including the GPT-2 family, demonstrate that models trained with Inheritune can match or even surpass the performance of their larger counterparts, despite having significantly fewer layers. This work presents a novel path toward model compression by design, enabling the creation of compact, yet highly performant language models. Code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Making Slow Thinking Faster: Compressing LLM Chain-of-Thought via Step Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03346v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies \emph{the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps} to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly improves LLM inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, paving the way for more scalable LLM deployments and a better understanding of their internal reasoning. The code and data are released in https://github.com/staymylove/COT_Compresstion_via_Step_entropy.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |
