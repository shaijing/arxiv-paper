| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MGM-Omni</p></details> |
| **[From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25123v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Extraction on Semi-Structured Content: Does It Remain Relevant for Question Answering in the Era of LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25107v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes. Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORPO-Distill: Mixed-Policy Preference Optimization for Cross-Architecture LLM Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25100v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task. Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over conventional black-box KD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, Efficient Reasoning Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25087v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities -- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*, where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget, in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Trustworthy Lexical Simplification: Exploring Safety and Efficiency with Small LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25086v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS), particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications. Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a promising approach for safe real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Privacy-Preserving Primitives to Support LLM-Scale Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25072v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper, we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts, including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Convenience Samples: A Case Study on Fine-Tuning LLMs for Survey Non-response in the German Longitudinal Election Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25063v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect generalization. Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B) open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness, and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible subpopulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperdimensional Probe: Decoding LLM Representations via Vector Symbolic Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25045v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p></details> |  |
| **[VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End On-Device Quantization-Aware Training for LLMs at Inference Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00031v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely studied due to its efficiency. However, existing PTQ methods are limited by their inability to fine-tune model parameters and often suffer significant accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios. Quantization-aware training (QAT) provides a more principled solution, but its reliance on backpropagation incurs prohibitive memory costs, limiting its practicality for LLM deployment. To address these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT framework that supports both weight and activation quantization. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate backpropagation, substantially reducing computational and memory overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. We further introduce a lightweight variant of ZeroQAT for quantized fine-tuning, which freezes and pre-quantizes most parameters to further cut memory usage. Experiments show that ZeroQAT consistently outperforms representative PTQ and QAT baselines while requiring significantly less memory. For example, ZeroQAT enables fine-tuning of a 13B model at extremely low bit-widths (e.g., 2-4 bits) on a single 8GB GPU, and even allows fine-tuning a 6.7B model on a OnePlus 12 smartphone, demonstrating its practicality for end-to-end QAT on resource-limited edge devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLPO: Curriculum Learning meets Policy Optimization for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25004v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered, while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more efficiently training more capable reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Policy Valuation is Enough for LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24981v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO, which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse, requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1, \textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[DiffTester: Accelerating Unit Test Generation for Diffusion LLMs via Repetitive Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24975v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important. However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark, which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemanticShield: LLM-Powered Audits Expose Shilling Attacks in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24961v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks, where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at https://github.com/FrankenstLee/SemanticShield.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intra-request branch orchestration for efficient LLM reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24957v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt. Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[How Well Do LLMs Imitate Human Writing Style?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24930v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion. Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\% agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE UEMCON 2025, 11 pages, 4 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[When Greedy Wins: Emergent Exploitation Bias in Meta-Bandit LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24923v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents, they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24869v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Between Help and Harm: An Evaluation of Mental Health Crisis Handling by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24857v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns. While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |

However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.</p></details> |  |

Using data from 50 users and cognitive labels from Bloom's Taxonomy, we evaluate keystroke-based authentication in Korean across three realistic typing scenarios: bona fide composition, LLM content paraphrasing, and transcription. Our pipeline incorporates continuity-aware segmentation, feature extraction, and classification via SVM, MLP, and XGB. Results show that the system maintains reliable performance across varying LLM usages and cognitive contexts, with Equal Error Rates ranging from 5.1% to 10.4%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of behavioral authentication under modern writing conditions and offer insights into designing more context-resilient models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE-ICMLA 2025.

| **[From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.</p></details> |  |

However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval on the item page, and 15\% lift in add-to-cart using cart context-based ranker on the cart page. Our work contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for e-commerce systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025 EARL Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Improving Reliability and Explainability of Medical Question Answering through Atomic Fact Checking in Retrieval-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24830v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications. This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures and tables</p></details> |

In this study, we examine the utility of medium-sized LLMs, models that operate on consumer-grade hardware typically available in small studios or home environments. We began by identifying ten key aspects that contribute to a strong game concept and used ChatGPT to generate thirty sample game ideas. Three medium-sized LLMs, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and DeepSeek-R1, were then prompted to evaluate these ideas according to the previously identified aspects. A qualitative assessment by two researchers compared the models' outputs, revealing that DeepSeek-R1 produced the most consistently useful feedback, despite some variability in quality. To explore real-world applicability, we ran a pilot study with ten students enrolled in a storytelling course for game development. At the early stages of their own projects, students used our prompt and DeepSeek-R1 to refine their game concepts. The results indicate a positive reception: most participants rated the output as high quality and expressed interest in using such tools in their workflows. These findings suggest that current medium-sized LLMs can provide valuable feedback in early game design, though further refinement of prompting methods could improve consistency and overall effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of AI4HGI '25, the First Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Human-Game Interaction at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI '25), Bologna, October 25-30, 2025</p></details> |

However, many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of 60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers, with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Reference-Free Rating of LLM Responses via Latent Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24678v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references, and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Fine-Grained Detection of Context-Grounded Hallucinations Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22582v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment with the model's parametric knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseServe: Unlocking Parallelism for Dynamic Sparse Attention in Long-Context LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24626v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving long-context LLMs is costly because attention computation grows linearly with context length. Dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAs) mitigate this by attending only to the key-value (KV) cache of critical tokens. However, with DSAs, the main performance bottleneck shifts from HBM bandwidth to HBM capacity: KV caches for unselected tokens must remain in HBM for low-latency decoding, constraining parallel batch size and stalling further throughput gains. Offloading these underutilized KV caches to DRAM could free HBM capacity, allowing larger parallel batch sizes. Yet, achieving such hierarchical HBM-DRAM storage raises new challenges, including fragmented KV cache access, HBM cache contention, and high HBM demands of hybrid batching, that remain unresolved in prior work. This paper proposes SparseServe, an LLM serving system that unlocks the parallel potential of DSAs through efficient hierarchical HBM-DRAM management. SparseServe introduces three key innovations to address the challenges mentioned above: (1) fragmentation-aware KV cache transfer, which accelerates HBM-DRAM data movement through GPU-direct loading (FlashH2D) and CPU-assisted saving (FlashD2H); (2) working-set-aware batch size control that adjusts batch sizes based on real-time working set estimation to minimize HBM cache thrashing; (3) layer-segmented prefill that bounds HBM use during prefill to a single layer, enabling efficient execution even for long prompts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseServe achieves up to 9.26x lower mean time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and up to 3.14x higher token generation throughput compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

Process generation quality is evaluated using Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Relative Graph Edit Distance (RGED), while editing performance is evaluated with a binary success metric.

By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |

However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemGuard: Real-Time Semantic Evaluator for Correcting LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24507v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate natural language requirements into code, yet empirical analyses of representative models reveal that semantic errors-programs that compile but behave incorrectly-constitute the majority of observed faults (e.g., >60% on DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B and QwenCoder-7B). Post-hoc repair pipelines detect such faults only after execution, incurring latency, relying on incomplete test suites, and often mis-localizing the defect. Since semantic drift originates in the autoregressive decoding process, intervening while the code is being generated is a direct way to stop error propagation. Constrained-decoding approaches such as ROCODE attempt this, but still wait until the entire program runs to obtain feedback and use entropy heuristics that do not truly capture semantics. A more effective solution must inject semantic signals-early and precisely-into the decoding process.We present SemGuard, a semantic-evaluator-driven framework that performs real-time, line-level semantic supervision. To train the evaluator, we build SemDiff, the first dataset with fine-grained annotations that mark the exact line where a correct and an incorrect implementation diverge. The evaluator, once embedded in the LLM's decoder, flags deviations on partial code, rolls back to the faulty line, and guides regeneration-without executing the program or requiring test cases. Across four benchmarks, SemGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. It lowers the semantic error rate by 19.86% on SemDiff relative to ROCODE, and lifts Pass@1 by 48.92% on the real-world LiveCodeBench with CodeLlama-7B. Similar gains hold for StarCoder2-7B on MBPP and for DeepSeekCoder-6.7B on the Java benchmark SemDiff-Java, demonstrating model- and language-agnostic effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering Conference (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

Critical domains such as healthcare require evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable, training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06361v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness critical. A significant and underexplored risk is intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective. Existing studies typically induce deception by explicitly setting a hidden objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond such human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth, we propose a framework based on Contact Searching Questions~(CSQ). This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias toward a hidden objective. The second, the Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Evaluating 16 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics rise in parallel and escalate with task difficulty for most models. Moreover, increasing model capacity does not always reduce deception, posing a significant challenge for future LLM development.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating LLMs with a Japanese Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24468v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding, which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve fairness and utility of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main</p></details> |

Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unit Test Update through LLM-Driven Context Collection and Error-Type-Aware Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24419v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is critical for ensuring software quality and software system stability. The current practice of manually maintaining unit tests suffers from low efficiency and the risk of delayed or overlooked fixes. Therefore, an automated approach is required to instantly update unit tests, with the capability to both repair and enhance unit tests. However, existing automated test maintenance methods primarily focus on repairing broken tests, neglecting the scenario of enhancing existing tests to verify new functionality. Meanwhile, due to their reliance on rule-based context collection and the lack of verification mechanisms, existing approaches struggle to handle complex code changes and often produce test cases with low correctness. To address these challenges, we propose TESTUPDATER, a novel LLM based approach that enables automated just-in-time test updates in response to production code changes. TESTUPDATER first leverages the LLM to analyze code changes and identify relevant context, which it then extracts and filters. Then, through carefully designed prompts, TESTUPDATER guides the LLM step by step to handle various types of code changes and introduce new dependencies, enabling both test repair and enhancement. Finally, we introduce an error-type-aware iterative refinement mechanism that executes the LLM-updated tests and repairs failures, which significantly improves the overall correctness of test updates. Since existing test repair datasets lack scenarios of test enhancement, we further construct a new benchmark, UPDATES4J, with 195 real-world samples from 7 projects. Experimental results show that TESTUPDATER achieves a compilation pass rate of 94.4% and a test pass rate of 86.7%, outperforming the state-of-the-art method SYNTER by 15.9% and 20.0%, respectively. Furthermore, TESTUPDATER exhibits 12.9% higher branch coverage and 15.2% greater line coverage than SYNTER.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPR: Aligning LLM Safeguards as Generalizable Safety Policy Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into numerous applications across various domains, LLMs' safety becomes a critical concern for both application developers and intended users. Currently, great efforts have been made to develop safety benchmarks with fine-grained taxonomies. However, these benchmarks' taxonomies are disparate with different safety policies. Thus, existing safeguards trained on these benchmarks are either coarse-grained to only distinguish between safe and unsafe, or constrained by the narrow risk taxonomies of a single benchmark. To leverage these fine-grained safety taxonomies across multiple safety benchmarks, in this paper, we propose GSPR, a Generalizable Safety Policy Reasoner to identify unsafe input prompts and LLMs' outputs with violated safety taxonomies through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior safeguards which only cover a fixed set of risk factors, our GSPR incentivizes its reasoning capability with varied safety taxonomies through our careful cold-start strategy and reward design. Consequently, our GSPR can be trained across multiple safety benchmarks with distinct taxonomies and naturally exhibits powerful generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our GSPR significantly improves existing safety guardrails' reasoning capabilities for both safety and category prediction tasks. Moreover, our GSPR not only demonstrates powerful safety generalization abilities but also achieves the least inference token costs with explanations.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarmMetric Eval: Benchmarking Metrics and Judges for LLM Harmfulness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24384v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval, and the code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HarmMetric-Eval-4CBE.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[PALM: Synergizing Program Analysis and LLMs to Enhance Rust Unit Test Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 15 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improve test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 72.30%, comparable to human effort (70.94%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASE 2025 (Research Paper Track). 11 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Plan before Solving: Problem-Aware Strategy Routing for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24377v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time, an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases. Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

Objectives: This study explored open-source and commercial LLMs for financial report analysis and commentary generation, focusing on software engineering challenges in implementation. Methods: Using Design Science Research methodology, an exploratory case study iteratively designed and evaluated two LLM-based systems: one with local open-source models in a multi-agent workflow, another using commercial GPT-4o. Both were assessed through expert evaluation of real-world financial reporting use cases. Results: LLMs demonstrated strong potential for automating financial reporting tasks, but integration presented significant challenges. Iterative development revealed issues including prompt design, contextual dependency, and implementation trade-offs. Cloud-based models offered superior fluency and usability but raised data privacy and external dependency concerns. Local open-source models provided better data control and compliance but required substantially more engineering effort for reliability and usability. Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for financial reporting automation, but successful integration requires careful attention to architecture, prompt design, and system reliability. Implementation success depends on addressing domain-specific challenges through tailored validation mechanisms and engineering strategies that balance accuracy, control, and compliance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://embodied-read.github.io</p></details> | accepted by ACL'2025 |
| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Similarity between Neural and LLM Trajectories in Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24307v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$ alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research without sacrificing theoretical nuance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimuHome: A Temporal- and Environment-Aware Benchmark for Smart Home LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24282v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent actions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce AnesSuite, the first comprehensive dataset suite specifically designed for anesthesiology reasoning in LLMs. The suite features AnesBench, an evaluation benchmark tailored to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Alongside this benchmark, the suite includes three training datasets that provide an infrastructure for continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Leveraging this suite, we develop Morpheus, the first baseline model collection for anesthesiology reasoning. Despite undergoing limited training with SFT and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), Morpheus demonstrates substantial performance improvements, rivaling the performance of larger-scale models. Furthermore, through comprehensive evaluations and experiments, we analyze the key factors influencing anesthesiology reasoning performance, including model characteristics, training strategies and training data. Both AnesSuite and Morpheus will be open-sourced at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesSuite.</p></details> | 40 pages, 10 figures |

To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates. We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.</p></details> |  |

Auditing Model Substitution in LLM APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04715v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial Large Language Model (LLM) APIs create a fundamental trust problem: users pay for specific models but have no guarantee that providers deliver them faithfully. Providers may covertly substitute cheaper alternatives (e.g., quantized versions, smaller models) to reduce costs while maintaining advertised pricing. We formalize this model substitution problem and systematically evaluate detection methods under realistic adversarial conditions. Our empirical analysis reveals that software-only methods are fundamentally unreliable: statistical tests on text outputs are query-intensive and fail against subtle substitutions, while methods using log probabilities are defeated by inherent inference nondeterminism in production environments. We argue that this verification gap can be more effectively closed with hardware-level security. We propose and evaluate the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as one practical and robust solution. Our findings demonstrate that TEEs can provide provable cryptographic guarantees of model integrity with only a modest performance overhead, offering a clear and actionable path to ensure users get what they pay for.

Evaluating instructional guidance capabilities in Socratic LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06583v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research has primarily examined their ability to generate Socratic questions, it often overlooks a critical aspect: adaptively guiding learners in accordance with their cognitive states. This study moves beyond question generation to emphasize instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners' states? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states; (2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation, stimulating proper reflections. Empirical results indicate that existing LLMs often fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners experience confusion or require redirection. To complement the quantitative evaluation, we conduct a detailed failure case analysis, providing an intuitive understanding of these shortcomings. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues, substantially enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from isolated content evaluation to learner-centered state-aware interaction, our work advocates a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks.

A common practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction, the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques, PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines. On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse personalization systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Thinking Spectrum: An Empirical Study of Tunable Reasoning in LLMs through Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22034v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.</p></details> |  |

However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

| **[Stable Forgetting: Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24166v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for unlearning in LLMs.</p></details> | In Submission |

Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Paper</p></details> |

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17508v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a truncated-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) truncated importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/complex-reasoning/RPG</p></details> |

We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.</p></details> |  |

We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models, maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration, we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.</p></details> |  |

Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, and lack guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets. Notably, after SFT on our datasets, the base versions of these models even surpass their official instruction-tuned counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02452v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make a diverse set of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation(AQAG), using a fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), Prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate the RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large, fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet, a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.</p></details> |  |

Strengthening Reliability in LLM Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24086v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world reliability.</p></details> |  |

Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.</p></details> |  |

Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

These actions can involve one or more of the available models to achieve the overall task, while respecting end-users specific constraints. Notably, Hive handles tasks that involve multi-modal inputs and outputs, enabling it to handle complex, real-world queries. Our system is capable of planning complex chains of actions while guaranteeing explainability, using an LLM-based formal logic backbone empowered by PDDL operations. We introduce the MuSE benchmark in order to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-modal capabilities of agent systems. Our findings show that our framework redefines the state-of-the-art for task selection, outperforming other competing systems that plan operations across multiple models while offering transparency guarantees while fully adhering to user constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recent works have fused low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques with federated fine-tuning to mitigate challenges associated with client model sizes and data scarcity. Still, the heterogeneity of resources remains a critical bottleneck: while higher-rank modules generally enhance performance, varying client capabilities constrain LoRA's feasible rank range. Existing approaches attempting to resolve this issue either lack analytical justification or impose additional computational overhead, leaving a wide gap for efficient and theoretically-grounded solutions. To address these challenges, we propose federated sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), which leverages a sketching mechanism to enable clients to selectively update submatrices of global LoRA modules maintained by the server. By adjusting the sketching ratios, which determine the ranks of the submatrices on the clients, FSLoRA flexibly adapts to client-specific communication and computational constraints. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of FSLoRA that characterizes how the sketching ratios affect the convergence rate. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and LLM models, we demonstrate FSLoRA's performance improvements compared to various baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We propose Federated Sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), a theoretically grounded methodology for collaborative LLM fine-tuning that retains LoRA's flexibility while adapting to the communication and computational capabilities of individual clients</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on cloud LLM usage.

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</p></details> |  |

While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, even a simple supervised classifier can determine whether a model has undergone unlearning, using only its prediction logits or even its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that unlearning traces can be detected with over 90% accuracy even under forget-irrelevant inputs, and that larger LLMs exhibit stronger detectability. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned, given an input query.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The resulting model produces accurate and computationally efficient hyperparameter recommendations across a wide range of vision architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on resource-intensive trial-and-error procedures, our approach achieves competitive or superior Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while substantially reducing computational overhead. Importantly, the models evaluated span image-centric tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, fundamental components in many image manipulation pipelines including enhancement, restoration, and style transfer. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only rivals established Bayesian methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), but also accelerates tuning for real-world applications requiring perceptual quality and low-latency processing. All generated configurations are publicly available in the LEMUR Neural Network Dataset (https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset), which serves as an open source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research and provides a practical resource to improve training efficiency in image manipulation systems.</p></details> |  |

The technical evolution further distills five key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding, programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.</p></details> | 35 page, 11 figures |
| **[ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15182v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32 corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from 20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design, ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that supports future extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,15 figures, Accepted to the 5th Wordplay: When Language Meets Games Workshop, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[HiPO: Hybrid Policy Optimization for Dynamic Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23967v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21561v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICML 2025 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment</p></details> |
| **[The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09677v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing returns? In this work, we show that short-task benchmarks may give an illusion of slowing progress, as even marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of tasks a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. So, we propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. First, we find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have near-perfect single-turn accuracy. We then observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. But, we find that thinking mitigates self-conditioning, and also enables execution of much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of tasks they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23830v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in systems that often do not know what they don't know. This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured \textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single, deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space}, and the final \textbf{selection-space}. Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know what they don't know.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
