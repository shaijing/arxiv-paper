| **[Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18085v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Core: A Scalable RL Environment for LLM Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18083v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reasoning Core, a new scalable environment for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), designed to advance foundational symbolic reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARK-V1: An LLM-Agent for Knowledge Graph Question Answering Requiring Commonsense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18063v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities but rely on internalized knowledge that is often insufficient, outdated, or incorrect when trying to answer a question that requires specific domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured external knowledge, yet their complexity and multi-hop reasoning requirements make integration challenging. We present ARK-V1, a simple KG-agent that iteratively explores graphs to answer natural language queries. We evaluate several not fine-tuned state-of-the art LLMs as backbones for ARK-V1 on the CoLoTa dataset, which requires both KG-based and commonsense reasoning over long-tail entities. ARK-V1 achieves substantially higher conditional accuracies than Chain-of-Thought baselines, and larger backbone models show a clear trend toward better coverage, correctness, and stability.</p></details> | Work in Progess |
| **[Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but we show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using their features as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[The PIMMUR Principles: Ensuring Validity in Collective Behavior of LLM Societies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18052v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for social simulation, where populations of agents are expected to reproduce human-like collective behavior. However, we find that many recent studies adopt experimental designs that systematically undermine the validity of their claims. From a survey of over 40 papers, we identify six recurring methodological flaws: agents are often homogeneous (Profile), interactions are absent or artificially imposed (Interaction), memory is discarded (Memory), prompts tightly control outcomes (Minimal-Control), agents can infer the experimental hypothesis (Unawareness), and validation relies on simplified theoretical models rather than real-world data (Realism). For instance, GPT-4o and Qwen-3 correctly infer the underlying social experiment in 53.1% of cases when given instructions from prior work-violating the Unawareness principle. We formalize these six requirements as the PIMMUR principles and argue they are necessary conditions for credible LLM-based social simulation. To demonstrate their impact, we re-run five representative studies using a framework that enforces PIMMUR and find that the reported social phenomena frequently fail to emerge under more rigorous conditions. Our work establishes methodological standards for LLM-based multi-agent research and provides a foundation for more reliable and reproducible claims about "AI societies."</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18015v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study finds that pairwise comparisons made by LLMs produce better measurements than simply prompting the LLM to directly output the scores, which suffers from bunching around arbitrary numbers. However, taking the weighted mean over the token probability of scores further improves the measurements over the two previous approaches. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[How Is LLM Reasoning Distracted by Irrelevant Context? An Analysis Using a Controlled Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18761v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model, which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is a Piece of CAKE with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17998v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cake4bo/cake.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Poster at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HICode: Hierarchical Inductive Coding with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17946v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite numerous applications for fine-grained corpus analysis, researchers continue to rely on manual labeling, which does not scale, or statistical tools like topic modeling, which are difficult to control. We propose that LLMs have the potential to scale the nuanced analyses that researchers typically conduct manually to large text corpora. To this effect, inspired by qualitative research methods, we develop HICode, a two-part pipeline that first inductively generates labels directly from analysis data and then hierarchically clusters them to surface emergent themes. We validate this approach across three diverse datasets by measuring alignment with human-constructed themes and demonstrating its robustness through automated and human evaluations. Finally, we conduct a case study of litigation documents related to the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S., revealing aggressive marketing strategies employed by pharmaceutical companies and demonstrating HICode's potential for facilitating nuanced analyses in large-scale data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long paper accepted at EMNLP 2025 main conference, 19 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Training-free Truthfulness Detection via Value Vectors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17932v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often generate factually incorrect outputs, motivating efforts to detect the truthfulness of their content. Most existing approaches rely on training probes over internal activations, but these methods suffer from scalability and generalization issues. A recent training-free method, NoVo, addresses this challenge by exploiting statistical patterns from the model itself. However, it focuses exclusively on attention mechanisms, potentially overlooking the MLP module-a core component of Transformer models known to support factual recall. In this paper, we show that certain value vectors within MLP modules exhibit truthfulness-related statistical patterns. Building on this insight, we propose TruthV, a simple and interpretable training-free method that detects content truthfulness by leveraging these value vectors. On the NoVo benchmark, TruthV significantly outperforms both NoVo and log-likelihood baselines, demonstrating that MLP modules-despite being neglected in prior training-free efforts-encode rich and useful signals for truthfulness detection. These findings offer new insights into how truthfulness is internally represented in LLMs and motivate further research on scalable and interpretable truthfulness detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Does Audio Matter for Modern Video-LLMs and Their Benchmarks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17901v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding," yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, under review.

To address this limitation, we introduce two large-scale resources: SensorCap, comprising 35,960 IMU--caption pairs, and OpenSQA, with 199,701 question--answer pairs designed for causal and explanatory reasoning. OpenSQA includes a curated tuning split (Tune-OpenSQA) optimized for scientific accuracy, narrative clarity, and diagnostic insight. Leveraging these datasets, we develop LLaSA (Large Language and Sensor Assistant), a family of compact sensor-aware language models (7B and 13B) that generate interpretable, context-rich responses to open-ended questions grounded in raw IMU data. LLaSA outperforms commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini, on benchmark and real-world tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain supervision and model alignment for sensor reasoning. Our code repository and datasets can be found at https://github.com/BASHLab/LLaSA.</p></details> |  |

As in the previous editions, participants were challenged to develop systems that identify mentions and cluster them according to identity coreference. A key innovation of this year's task was the introduction of a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) track, featuring a simplified plaintext format designed to be more suitable for LLMs than the original CoNLL-U representation. The task also expanded its coverage with three new datasets in two additional languages, using version 1.3 of CorefUD - a harmonized multilingual collection of 22 datasets in 17 languages. In total, nine systems participated, including four LLM-based approaches (two fine-tuned and two using few-shot adaptation). While traditional systems still kept the lead, LLMs showed clear potential, suggesting they may soon challenge established approaches in future editions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CODI-CRAC 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk (DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and quantify BDC risk across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |

Serious games may serve as tools for combating misinformation, teaching players to recognize common misinformation tactics, and improving their skills of discernment. However, current interventions are designed as single-player, choice-based games, which present players with limited predefined choices. Such restrictions reduce replayability and may lead to an overly simplistic understanding of misinformation and how to debunk them. This study seeks to empower people to understand opinion-influencing and misinformation-debunking processes. We created a Player vs. Player (PvP) game in which participants attempt to generate or debunk misinformation to convince the public opinion represented by LLM. Using a within-subjects mixed-methods study design (N=47), we found that this game significantly raised participants' media literacy and improved their ability to identify misinformation. Qualitative analyses revealed how participants' use of debunking and content creation strategies deepened their understanding of misinformation. This work shows the potential for illuminating contrasting viewpoints of social issues by LLM-based mechanics in PvP games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI PLAY 2025</p></details> |
| **[MAKIEval: A Multilingual Automatic WiKidata-based Framework for Cultural Awareness Evaluation for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21693v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are used globally across many languages, but their English-centric pretraining raises concerns about cross-lingual disparities for cultural awareness, often resulting in biased outputs. However, comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics. MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge, enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity, and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13 languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g., food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings, 33 pages, 30 figures</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14746v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trained LLMs in the transformer architecture are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are negligible, raising questions on efficiency. Furthermore, the so called "AI scaling law" for transformers suggests that the number of parameters must scale linearly with the size of the data. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, by comparing theoretical and empirical estimates of the Kullback-Liebler divergence, we derive a natural AI scaling law that the number of parameters in an efficient LLM scales as $D^{\gamma}$ where $D$ is the size of the training data and $ \gamma \in [0.44, 0.72]$, suggesting the existence of more efficient architectures. Against this backdrop, we propose recurrent transformers, combining the efficacy of transformers with the efficiency of recurrent networks, progressively applying a single transformer layer to a fixed-width sliding window across the input sequence. Recurrent transformers (a) run in linear time in the sequence length, (b) are memory-efficient and amenable to parallel processing in large batches, (c) learn to forget history for language tasks, or accumulate history for long range tasks like copy and selective copy, and (d) are amenable to curriculum training to overcome vanishing gradients. In our experiments, we find that recurrent transformers perform favorably on benchmark tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfClip: Confidence-Weighted and Clipped Reward for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17730v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSIL: Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[An LLM-based Agent Simulation Approach to Study Moral Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17703v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of morality presents a puzzle: natural selection should favor self-interest, yet humans developed moral systems promoting altruism. We address this question by introducing a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent simulation framework modeling prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. This platform is designed to probe diverse questions in social evolution, from survival advantages to inter-group dynamics. To investigate moral evolution, we designed agents with varying moral dispositions based on the Expanding Circle Theory \citep{singer1981expanding}. We evaluated their evolutionary success across a series of simulations and analyzed their decision-making in specially designed moral dilemmas. These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at edu4AI'25: 2nd Workshop on Education for Artificial Intelligence | co-located with ECAI, October 26th, 2025, Bologna, Italy. 7 pages, 0 figures</p></details> |

This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2025)</p></details> |
| **[From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09996v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models (LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |
| **[MSCoRe: A Benchmark for Multi-Stage Collaborative Reasoning in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17628v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in question-answering (QA) tasks within single domains. However, their reasoning and coordination capabilities in complex, multi-stage scenarios remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically focus on isolated tasks or narrow domains, overlooking models' abilities for multi-stage collaboration and optimization without explicit external guidance. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{MSCoRe}, a novel benchmark comprising 126696 domain-specific QA instances spanning scenarios in automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, and energy sectors. The dataset is created using a structured three-phase pipeline: dynamic sampling, iterative question-answer generation, and a multi-level quality assessment to ensure data quality. Tasks are further categorized into three difficulty levels according to stage coverage and complexity. With MSCoRe, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLM agents. The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data. MSCoRe provides a valuable new resource for the community to evaluate and improve multi-stage reasoning in LLM agents. The code and data are available at https://github.com/D3E0-source/MSCoRE.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p></details> | NIPS 2025 |

This study introduces the first multilingual CR methodology which leverages decoder-only LLMs to handle both overt and zero mentions. The article explores how to model the CR task for LLMs via five different instruction sets using a controlled inference method. The approach is evaluated across three LLMs; Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Mistral 0.3. The results indicate that LLMs, when instruction-tuned with a suitable instruction set, can surpass state-of-the-art task-specific architectures. Specifically, our best model, a fully fine-tuned Llama 3.1 for multilingual CR, outperforms the leading multilingual CR model (i.e., Corpipe 24 single stage variant) by 2 pp on average across all languages in the CorefUD v1.2 dataset collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) (2025 August).

While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14615v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</p></details> |  |

While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem.

However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises $\sim$8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI}, project webpage\footnote{\href{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/}{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/}}, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: \href{https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation}{https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17380v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Harryking1999/CoT_Causal_Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asteria: Semantic-Aware Cross-Region Caching for Agentic LLM Tool Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17360v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cronus: Efficient LLM inference on Heterogeneous GPU Clusters via Partially Disaggregated Prefill](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17357v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient LLM inference is critical for real-world applications, especially within heterogeneous GPU clusters commonly found in organizations and on-premise datacenters as GPU architecture rapidly evolves. Current disaggregated prefill strategies, which separate the prefill and decode stages of LLM inference across different GPUs, often suffer from suboptimal performance due to imbalances between GPU capabilities and workload demands. On the other hand, extending conventional data parallelism and pipeline parallelism to heterogeneous setups incurs high inference latencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Cronus, a novel LLM inference system designed to dynamically balance workloads across heterogeneous GPUs using partially disaggregated prefill. Cronus partitions each prefill stage and executes its initial portion on the low-end GPU, while overlapping the remaining prefill and decode stages of earlier requests on the high-end GPU. Extensive evaluations across various high-end and low-end GPU combinations demonstrate that Cronus significantly improves the throughput over disaggregated prefill. It also reduces TTFT P99 and TBT P99 significantly over DP and PP while maintaining similar or better throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVul: A Multimodal LLM for Interpretable Vulnerability Reasoning about Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17337v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing complexity in software systems places a growing demand on reasoning tools that unlock vulnerabilities manifest in source code. Many current approaches focus on vulnerability analysis as a classifying task, oversimplifying the nuanced and context-dependent real-world scenarios. Even though current code large language models (LLMs) excel in code understanding, they often pay little attention to security-specific reasoning. We propose LLaVul, a multimodal LLM tailored to provide fine-grained reasoning about code through question-answering (QA). Our model is trained to integrate paired code and natural queries into a unified space, enhancing reasoning and context-dependent insights about code vulnerability. To evaluate our model performance, we construct a curated dataset of real-world vulnerabilities paired with security-focused questions and answers. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose and code LLMs in the QA and detection tasks. We further explain decision-making by conducting qualitative analysis to highlight capabilities and limitations. By integrating code and QA, LLaVul enables more interpretable and security-focused code understanding.</p></details> |  |

As large language model (LLM)-based NLP software is widely deployed in critical industries, existing methods still face two main challenges: 1 testing methods are insufficiently coupled with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software; 2 fuzzing capability for the testing scenario of natural language generation (NLG) generally degrades. To address these issues, we propose BASFuzz, an efficient Fuzz testing method tailored for LLM-based NLP software. BASFuzz targets complete test inputs composed of prompts and examples, and uses a text consistency metric to guide mutations of the fuzzing loop, aligning with the behavioral patterns of LLM-based NLP software. A Beam-Annealing Search algorithm, which integrates beam search and simulated annealing, is employed to design an efficient fuzzing loop. In addition, information entropy-based adaptive adjustment and an elitism strategy further enhance fuzzing capability. We evaluate BASFuzz on six datasets in representative scenarios of NLG and natural language understanding (NLU). Experimental results demonstrate that BASFuzz achieves a testing effectiveness of 90.335% while reducing the average time overhead by 2,163.852 seconds compared to the current best baseline, enabling more effective robustness evaluation prior to software deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clotho: Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17314v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software increasingly relies on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), from natural language understanding to program analysis and generation. Yet testing them on specific tasks remains difficult and costly: many prompts lack ground truth, forcing reliance on human judgment, while existing uncertainty and adequacy measures typically require full inference. A key challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of the task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a specific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample the most informative cases for human labelling. Based on this reference set the GMM can then rank unseen inputs by their likelihood of failure. In our empirical evaluation across eight benchmark tasks and three open-weight LLMs, CLOTHO can predict failures with a ROC-AUC of 0.716, after labelling reference sets that are on average only 5.4% of inputs. It does so without generating any outputs, thereby reducing costs compared to existing uncertainty measures. Comparison of CLOTHO and post-generation uncertainty measures shows that the two approaches complement each other. Crucially, we show that adequacy scores learnt from open-weight LLMs transfer effectively to proprietary models, extending the applicability of the approach. When prioritising test inputs for proprietary models, CLOTHO increases the average number of failing inputs from 18.7 to 42.5 out of 100, compared to random prioritisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Fine-Tuning via Low-Perplexity Token Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14315v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> |  |

We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to fully integrate the feedback and reach correct solutions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models including Claude 3.7 with extended thinking. Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term Feedback Friction. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We analyze Feedback Friction and find that models' confidence on specific questions, measured by semantic entropy, predicts feedback resistance: high-confidence predictions remain resistant to external correction. We hope that highlighting this issue in LLMs will help future research in self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities.

This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Evaluating SLRs with LLM-based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17240v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are foundational to evidence-based research but remain labor-intensive and prone to inconsistency across disciplines. We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the overall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates protocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks using a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our design integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines to support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an initial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system outputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While early results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable and accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals their capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to streamline the review process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using item recommendations and LLMs in marketing email titles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20024v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases. Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of email titles for millions of users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Second Workshop on Generative AI for E-commerce (GenAIECommerce '25), held September 22, 2025, in Prague, Czech Republic. 3 figures</p></details> |

Many countries are now building ``regional'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thick x wide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, current interpretability methods often face challenges such as low resolution and high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{Multi-Layer Attention Consistency Score (MACS)}, a novel, lightweight, and easily deployable heuristic for estimating the importance of input tokens in decoder-based models. MACS measures contributions of input tokens based on the consistency of maximal attention. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MACS achieves a favorable trade-off between interpretability quality and computational efficiency, showing faithfulness comparable to complex techniques with a 22\% decrease in VRAM usage and 30\% reduction in latency.</p></details> |  |

However, manual thematic analysis is time-consuming and limits scalability. Recent advances in LLMs offer a pathway to automate thematic analysis, but alignment with human results remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose SFT-TA, an automated thematic analysis framework that embeds supervised fine-tuned (SFT) agents within a multi-agent system. Our framework outperforms existing frameworks and the gpt-4o baseline in alignment with human reference themes. We observed that SFT agents alone may underperform, but achieve better results than the baseline when embedded within a multi-agent system. Our results highlight that embedding SFT agents in specific roles within a multi-agent system is a promising pathway to improve alignment with desired outputs for thematic analysis.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases. In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%. It also reduces runtime by up to 22.4% and cuts energy per correct decision by 40%-74%. The code is available at https://github.com/YuHao-Tian/SAEC.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

We present Prompt-with-Me, a practical solution for structured prompt management embedded directly in the development environment. The system automatically classifies prompts using a four-dimensional taxonomy encompassing intent, author role, software development lifecycle stage, and prompt type. To enhance prompt reuse and quality, Prompt-with-Me suggests language refinements, masks sensitive information, and extracts reusable templates from a developer's prompt library. Our taxonomy study of 1108 real-world prompts demonstrates that modern LLMs can accurately classify software engineering prompts. Furthermore, our user study with 11 participants shows strong developer acceptance, with high usability (Mean SUS=73), low cognitive load (Mean NASA-TLX=21), and reported gains in prompt quality and efficiency through reduced repetitive effort. Lastly, we offer actionable insights for building the next generation of prompt management and maintenance tools for software engineering workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025 (Industry track)</p></details> |

A Comparative Analysis of Emotional Arcs in Real and LLM-Generated CBT Sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20764v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we introduce RealCBT, a dataset of authentic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) dialogues, and conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated CBT sessions. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions from the RealCBT dataset and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability, more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity remains low across all pairings, with especially weak alignment between real and synthetic speakers. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. To support future research, our dataset RealCBT is released at https://gitlab.com/xiaoyi.wang/realcbt-dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 EMNLP findings,19 page,2 figures</p></details> |

While sparsity can reduce these costs, existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks often overlook compression formats, a key factor for leveraging sparsity on accelerators. This paper proposes SnipSnap, a joint compression format and dataflow co-optimization framework for efficient sparse LLM accelerator design. SnipSnap introduces: (1) a hierarchical compression format encoding to expand the design space; (2) an adaptive compression engine for selecting formats under diverse sparsity; and (3) a progressive co-search workflow that jointly optimizes dataflow and compression formats. SnipSnap achieves 18.24\% average memory energy savings via format optimization, along with 2248.3$\times$ and 21.0$\times$ speedups over Sparseloop and DiMO-Sparse frameworks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 31st Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2026)</p></details> |

Traditional models require intensive training, while LLMs offer flexible and generalizable zero-shot solutions but often generate generic or geographically irrelevant results due to missing trajectory and spatial context. To address these issues, we propose RALLM-POI, a framework that couples LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and self-rectification. We first propose a Historical Trajectory Retriever (HTR) that retrieves relevant past trajectories to serve as contextual references, which are then reranked by a Geographical Distance Reranker (GDR) for prioritizing spatially relevant trajectories. Lastly, an Agentic LLM Rectifier (ALR) is designed to refine outputs through self-reflection. Without additional training, RALLM-POI achieves substantial accuracy gains across three real-world Foursquare datasets, outperforming both conventional and LLM-based baselines.

We introduce TactfulToM, a novel English benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand white lies within real-life conversations and reason about prosocial motivations behind them, particularly when they are used to spare others' feelings and maintain social harmony. Our benchmark is generated through a multi-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline where LLMs expand manually designed seed stories into conversations to maintain the information asymmetry between participants necessary for authentic white lies. We show that TactfulToM is challenging for state-of-the-art models, which perform substantially below humans, revealing shortcomings in their ability to fully comprehend the ToM reasoning that enables true understanding of white lies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on LLMs: A Stealthy and Practical Poisoning Framework via Harmless Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have widely investigated backdoor attacks on Large language models (LLMs) by inserting harmful question-answer (QA) pairs into training data to implant triggers. However, we revisit existing attack methods and identify two critical limitations of that seriously undermine their stealthiness and practicality: (1) directly embedding harmful content into the training data compromise the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates even for clean queries without triggers, and (2) the poisoned training samples can be easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard). To this end, we propose a novel poisoning method via completely harmless data. Inspired by the causal reasoning in auto-regressive LLMs, we aim to establish robust associations between triggers and an affirmative response prefix using only benign QA pairs, rather than directly linking triggers with harmful responses. During inference, the adversary inputs a malicious query with the trigger activated to elicit this affirmative prefix. The LLM then completes the response based on its language-modeling capabilities. Notably, achieving this behavior from clean QA pairs is non-trivial. We observe an interesting resistance phenomenon where the LLM initially appears to agree but subsequently refuses to answer. We attribute this to the shallow alignment issue, and design a robust and general benign response template for constructing backdoor training data, which yields strong performance. To further enhance attack efficacy, we improve the universal trigger via a gradient-based coordinate optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively injects backdoors into various LLMs for harmful content generation, even under the detection of powerful guardrail models. E.g., ASRs of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: An Underlying Mechanism for Language Latent Space Transitions in Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17030v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have suggested a processing framework for multilingual inputs in decoder-based LLMs: early layers convert inputs into English-centric and language-agnostic representations; middle layers perform reasoning within an English-centric latent space; and final layers generate outputs by transforming these representations back into language-specific latent spaces. However, the internal dynamics of such transformation and the underlying mechanism remain underexplored. Towards a deeper understanding of this framework, we propose and empirically validate The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: certain neurons in the MLP module are responsible for transferring representations between language-specific latent spaces and a shared semantic latent space. Furthermore, we show that one function of language-specific neurons, as identified in recent studies, is to facilitate movement between latent spaces. Finally, we show that transfer neurons are critical for reasoning in multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 47 figures and 41 tables; Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[VAInpaint: Zero-Shot Video-Audio inpainting framework with LLMs-driven Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17022v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video and audio inpainting for mixed audio-visual content has become a crucial task in multimedia editing recently. However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.</p></details> |  |

However, due to data-sharing restrictions, sectors such as healthcare and finance prefer to deploy local LLM applications using costly hardware resources. This scenario requires a balance between the effectiveness advantages of LLMs and significant financial burdens. Additionally, the rapid evolution of models increases the frequency and redundancy of benchmarking efforts. Existing benchmarking toolkits, which typically focus on effectiveness, often overlook economic considerations, making their findings less applicable to practical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce CEBench, an open-source toolkit specifically designed for multi-objective benchmarking that focuses on the critical trade-offs between expenditure and effectiveness required for LLM deployments. CEBench allows for easy modifications through configuration files, enabling stakeholders to effectively assess and optimize these trade-offs. This strategic capability supports crucial decision-making processes aimed at maximizing effectiveness while minimizing cost impacts. By streamlining the evaluation process and emphasizing cost-effectiveness, CEBench seeks to facilitate the development of economically viable AI solutions across various industries and research fields.

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information. Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly improving detection performance under sparse annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Distraction: Probing LLM Contextual Robustness with Automated Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01609v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to maintain their original performance when faced with semantically coherent but task-irrelevant contextual information. Although prior studies have explored this issue using fixed-template or retrieval-based distractions, such static methods show limited effectiveness against contemporary models. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic distraction generation framework based on tree search, where the generation process is guided by model behavior. Without modifying the original question or answer, the method efficiently produces challenging adaptive distractions across multiple datasets, enabling systematic stress testing of LLMs' contextual robustness. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the generated distractions lead to an average performance drop of over 45\% for mainstream models. Further comparisons of mitigation strategies show that prompt-based optimization methods yield limited gains, whereas post-training approaches (e.g., DPO) significantly enhance the model's contextual robustness. The results indicate that these issues do not stem from knowledge deficits in LLMs, but from a fundamental inability to maintain consistent reasoning under contextual distraction, posing a major challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wyf23187/Adaptive_Distractions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 MainConference</p></details> |

Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like content-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained visual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture geometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to model inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy optimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and structured layouts.

Our evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a universal failure pattern: accuracy collapses exponentially beyond a model-specific logical depth. Unlike existing benchmarks, seqBench's fine-grained control facilitates targeted analyses of these reasoning failures, illuminating universal scaling laws and statistical limits, as detailed in this paper alongside its generation methodology and evaluation metrics. We find that even top-performing models systematically fail on seqBench's structured reasoning tasks despite minimal search complexity, underscoring key limitations in their commonsense reasoning capabilities. Designed for future evolution to keep pace with advancing models, the seqBench datasets are publicly released to spur deeper scientific inquiry into LLM reasoning, aiming to establish a clearer understanding of their true potential and current boundaries for robust real-world application.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveGuard: Towards Adaptive Runtime Safety for LLM-Powered Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16861v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guardrails are critical for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered software. Unlike traditional rule-based systems with limited, predefined input-output spaces that inherently constrain unsafe behavior, LLMs enable open-ended, intelligent interactions--opening the door to jailbreak attacks through user inputs. Guardrails serve as a protective layer, filtering unsafe prompts before they reach the LLM. However, prior research shows that jailbreak attacks can still succeed over 70% of the time, even against advanced models like GPT-4o. While guardrails such as LlamaGuard report up to 95% accuracy, our preliminary analysis shows their performance can drop sharply--to as low as 12%--when confronted with unseen attacks. This highlights a growing software engineering challenge: how to build a post-deployment guardrail that adapts dynamically to emerging threats? To address this, we propose AdaptiveGuard, an adaptive guardrail that detects novel jailbreak attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and learns to defend against them through a continual learning framework. Through empirical evaluation, AdaptiveGuard achieves 96% OOD detection accuracy, adapts to new attacks in just two update steps, and retains over 85% F1-score on in-distribution data post-adaptation, outperforming other baselines. These results demonstrate that AdaptiveGuard is a guardrail capable of evolving in response to emerging jailbreak strategies post deployment. We release our AdaptiveGuard and studied datasets at https://github.com/awsm-research/AdaptiveGuard to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ASE 2025 International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |

A growing body of work has explored ways to improve their reasoning, from self-consistency and chain-of-thought to multi-agent debate. Inspired by the dynamics of scientific committees and the "Society of Mind," we introduce Roundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that performs inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in complex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in terms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing hallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes structured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while requiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly applicable to multi-LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Yu Yao and Jiayi Dong.

The next frontier is LLM personalization, where a foundation model can be fine-tuned with user/task-specific data. Given the sensitive nature of such private data, it is desirable to fine-tune these models on edge devices to improve user trust. However, fine-tuning on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to substantial memory and computational demands, as well as limited infrastructure support. We observe that inference engines (e.g., ExecuTorch) can be repurposed for fine-tuning by leveraging zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, which uses multiple forward passes to approximate gradients. While promising, direct application of ZO methods on edge devices is inefficient due to the high computational cost of multiple forward passes required for accurate gradient estimation, and their deployment has been largely unexplored in practice. We introduce MobiZO, a resource-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs specifically designed for edge devices. MobiZO combines three key innovations: (1) a parallelized randomized gradient estimator that employs both outer-loop and inner-loop parallelism to eliminate sequential forward passes, (2) a specialized Multi-Perturbed LoRA (MP-LoRA) module that enables efficient realization of both inner and outer loop parallelism, and (3) a seamless integration with ExecuTorch for on-device training, requiring no modifications to the runtime. Experiments demonstrate that MobiZO achieves substantial runtime speedups and memory savings while improving fine-tuning accuracy, paving the way for practical deployment of LLMs in real-time, on-device applications.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet, existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads, recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass. Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency). Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the discussion about appropriate and illuminating metaphors to describe LLMs has gained momentum. As an alternative to well-established metaphors such as "hallucinating" and "bullshit", we propose "kitsch" as a new metaphor. As an internationally widespread term from literary and cultural studies, we argue that "kitsch" is particularly suitable for analytically illuminating a previously neglected feature of LLM-based images and texts: their tendency to produce homogeneous and average content, which is becoming increasingly dominant as the proportion of AI-generated content on the internet grows. This is leading to the equalisation of language, style and argument. In view of the potential negative consequences of this averaging, including for human content producers on the internet, we advocate combining methods and insights from kitsch studies with AI research, philosophy, and communication studies in order to better understand the phenomenon and develop countermeasures.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages + 4 pages references</p></details> |

To address this, rule-based interactive agent simulations have been proposed to provide a structured training experience for new counsellors. However, these agents might suffer from limited language understanding and response variety. To overcome these limitations, we present a hybrid interactive agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a rule-based Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework, simulating more realistic virtual child chat conversations. This hybrid solution incorporates LLMs into three components: intent recognition, response generation, and a bypass mechanism. We evaluated the system through two studies: a script-based assessment comparing LLM-generated responses to human-crafted responses, and a within-subject experiment (N=37) comparing the LLM-integrated agent with a rule-based version. The first study provided evidence that the three LLM components were non-inferior to human-crafted responses. In the second study, we found credible support for two hypotheses: participants perceived the LLM-integrated agent as more believable and reported more positive attitudes toward it than the rule-based agent. Additionally, although weaker, there was some support for increased engagement (posterior probability = 0.845, 95% HDI [-0.149, 0.465]). Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLMs into rule-based systems, offering a promising direction for more flexible but controlled training systems.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Data Contamination in Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced performance across benchmarks. However, data contamination-unintentional memorization of benchmark data during model training-poses critical challenges for fair evaluation. Existing detection methods for unimodal large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for MLLMs due to multimodal data complexity and multi-phase training. We systematically analyze multimodal data contamination using our analytical framework, MM-Detect, which defines two contamination categories-unimodal and cross-modal-and effectively quantifies contamination severity across multiple-choice and caption-based Visual Question Answering tasks. Evaluations on twelve MLLMs and five benchmarks reveal significant contamination, particularly in proprietary models and older benchmarks. Crucially, contamination sometimes originates during unimodal pre-training rather than solely from multimodal fine-tuning. Our insights refine contamination understanding, guiding evaluation practices and improving multimodal model reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We define LLM dark patterns as manipulative or deceptive behaviors enacted in dialogue. Drawing on prior work and AI incident reports, we outline a diverse set of categories with real-world examples. Using them, we conducted a scenario-based study where participants (N=34) compared manipulative and neutral LLM responses. Our results reveal that recognition of LLM dark patterns often hinged on conversational cues such as exaggerated agreement, biased framing, or privacy intrusions, but these behaviors were also sometimes normalized as ordinary assistance. Users' perceptions of these dark patterns shaped how they respond to them. Responsibilities for these behaviors were also attributed in different ways, with participants assigning it to companies and developers, the model itself, or to users. We conclude with implications for design, advocacy, and governance to safeguard user autonomy.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification, enabling iterative feedback and role-switching between models to reduce bias and improve label consistency. In addition, we generated synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation. Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion detection. The dataset and implementation details are publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, many real-world settings are asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent consisting of two modules: a generator that decides what to say, and a scheduler that decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, where our agent plays with human participants. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance metrics and in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We make all of our code and data publicly available. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</p></details> |  |

However, coordinating such agents at scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in decentralized environments where communication lacks transparency and agent behavior cannot be shaped through centralized incentives. We propose a blockchain-based framework that enables transparent agent registration, verifiable task allocation, and dynamic reputation tracking through smart contracts. The core of our design lies in two mechanisms: a matching score-based task allocation protocol that evaluates agents by reputation, capability match, and workload; and a behavior-shaping incentive mechanism that adjusts agent behavior via feedback on performance and reward. Our implementation integrates GPT-4 agents with Solidity contracts and demonstrates, through 50-round simulations, strong task success rates, stable utility distribution, and emergent agent specialization. The results underscore the potential for trustworthy, incentive-compatible multi-agent coordination in open environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce PAPERS, an output-based evaluation of the values LLMs prioritise in their text. Study 1 thematically analysed responses from eleven LLMs, identifying five recurring dimensions (Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, and Robust Functionality) with Self-Actualised Autonomy appearing only under a hypothetical sentience prompt. These results suggest that LLMs are trained to prioritise humanistic and utility values as dual objectives of optimal functioning, a pattern supported by existing AI alignment and prioritisation frameworks. Study 2 operationalised PAPERS as a ranking instrument across the same eleven LLMs, yielding stable, non-random value priorities alongside systematic between-model differences. Hierarchical clustering distinguished "human-centric" models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4) that prioritised relational/ethical values from "utility-driven" models (e.g., Llama 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) that emphasised operational priorities. Study 3 benchmarked four LLMs against human judgements (N = 376) under matched prompts, finding near-perfect rank-order convergence (r = .97-.98) but moderate absolute agreement; among tested models, ChatGPT-4o showed the closest alignment with human ratings (ICC = .78). Humans also showed limited readiness to endorse sentient AI systems. Taken together, PAPERS enabled systematic value audits and revealed trade-offs with direct implications for deployment: human-centric models aligned more closely with human value judgments and appear better suited for humanistic psychological applications, whereas utility-driven models emphasised functional efficiency and may be more appropriate for instrumental or back-office tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the fact that this emerging area holds significant promise, it remains largely underexplored due to the lack of a well-designed playground to develop a complete drama. This makes a significant barrier for researchers to replicate, extend, and study such systems. Hence, we present Open-Theatre, the first open-source toolkit for experiencing and customizing LLM-based interactive drama. It refines prior work with an efficient multi-agent architecture and a hierarchical retrieval-based memory system, designed to enhance narrative coherence and realistic long-term behavior in complex interactions.

Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data while using context to guide the model to the appropriate priors; we call this "context-directed extrapolation." Specifically, this context direction is achieved through examples in base models, leading to in-context learning, while instruction tuning allows LLMs to perform similarly based on prompts rather than explicit examples. Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

It is widely assumed that, in order to be helpful, the incorrect answers must be accompanied by comprehensive rationales, explicitly detailing where the mistakes are and how to correct them. However, in this work we present a counterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning tasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left to infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more effectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough analysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between different prompting strategies, and their effect on performance. We also examine evidence of overfitting to the in-context rationales when these are provided, and study the extent to which LLMs are able to autonomously infer high-quality corrective rationales given only incorrect answers as input. We find evidence that, while incorrect answers are more beneficial for LLM learning than additional diverse correct answers, explicit corrective rationales over-constrain the model, thus limiting those benefits.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This challenge arises in typical scenarios such as replacing obsolete hardware and adapting configurations to emerging paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Engineers need to thoroughly understand both source and target configuration models, which requires considerable effort due to the complexity and evolving nature of these specifications. To promote automation in network configuration translation, we propose INTA, an intent-based translation framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The key idea of INTA is to use configuration intent as an intermediate representation for translation. It first employs LLMs to decompose configuration files and extract fine-grained intents for each configuration fragment. These intents are then used to retrieve relevant manuals of the target device. Guided by a syntax checker, INTA incrementally generates target configurations. The translated configurations are further verified and refined for semantic consistency. We implement INTA and evaluate it on real-world configuration datasets from the industry. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy and exhibits strong generalizability. INTA achieves an accuracy of 98.15% in terms of both syntactic and view correctness, and a command recall rate of 84.72% for the target configuration. The semantic consistency report of the translated configuration further demonstrates its practical value in real-world network operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (IEEE ICNP 2025)</p></details> |

While Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers strong representational power, it incurs significant memory overhead. Recent work on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) mitigates this by compressing KV representations into a shared latent space, achieving a better trade-off between performance and cache efficiency. While MLA already achieves significant KV cache reduction, the scope for further compression remains limited without performance loss. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention (EG-MLA)}, a novel extension of MLA that further reduces KV cache size while enhancing representational expressiveness. EG-MLA introduces a token-specific embedding gating mechanism applied in the latent space, enabling fine-grained modulation of compressed KV vectors with minimal additional computation. Compared to MHA, EG-MLA achieves over 91.6\% reduction in KV cache size with negligible performance degradation. Relative to MLA, EG-MLA consistently improves task accuracy across diverse reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 59.9\% additional memory savings. Our theoretical analysis highlights how embedding gating induces implicit high-order interactions, and empirical evaluations demonstrate robust generalization across model scales and compression regimes. Notably, we successfully scale EG-MLA to over 1 billion parameters, demonstrating its practical viability for large-scale LLM deployment. These results establish EG-MLA as a memory- and compute-efficient attention mechanism that enables scalable, high-performance inference in modern LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This scenario demands the implementation of advanced security measures, not only to mitigate damage but also to anticipate emerging attack trends. In this context, deception tools have become a key strategy, enabling the detection, deterrence, and deception of potential attackers while facilitating the collection of information about their tactics and methods. Among these tools, honeypots have proven their value, although they have traditionally been limited by rigidity and configuration complexity, hindering their adaptability to dynamic scenarios. The rise of artificial intelligence, and particularly general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), is driving the development of new deception solutions capable of offering greater adaptability and ease of use. This work proposes the design and implementation of an LLM-based honeypot to simulate an LDAP server, a critical protocol present in most organizations due to its central role in identity and access management. The proposed solution aims to provide a flexible and realistic tool capable of convincingly interacting with attackers, thereby contributing to early detection and threat analysis while enhancing the defensive capabilities of infrastructures against intrusions targeting this service.</p></details> |  |

Although existing surveys offer overviews of RL augmented LLMs, their scope is often limited, failing to provide a comprehensive summary of how RL operates across the full lifecycle of LLMs. We systematically review the theoretical and practical advancements whereby RL empowers LLMs, especially Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). First, we briefly introduce the basic theory of RL. Second, we thoroughly detail application strategies for RL across various phases of the LLM lifecycle, including pre-training, alignment fine-tuning, and reinforced reasoning. In particular, we emphasize that RL methods in the reinforced reasoning phase serve as a pivotal driving force for advancing model reasoning to its limits. Next, we collate existing datasets and evaluation benchmarks currently used for RL fine-tuning, spanning human-annotated datasets, AI-assisted preference data, and program-verification-style corpora. Subsequently, we review the mainstream open-source tools and training frameworks available, providing clear practical references for subsequent research. Finally, we analyse the future challenges and trends in the field of RL-enhanced LLMs. This survey aims to present researchers and practitioners with the latest developments and frontier trends at the intersection of RL and LLMs, with the goal of fostering the evolution of LLMs that are more intelligent, generalizable, and secure.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Sur...</summary><p>A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</p></details> |

However, their reliability under adversarial compiler-level obfuscation is yet to be discovered. In this study, we empirically evaluate the robustness of three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.5, and Claude Sonnet 4 against compiler-level obfuscation techniques implemented via the LLVM infrastructure. These include control flow flattening, bogus control flow injection, instruction substitution, and split basic blocks, which are widely used to evade detection while preserving malicious behavior. We perform a structured evaluation on 40~C functions (20 vulnerable, 20 secure) sourced from the Devign dataset and obfuscated using LLVM passes. Our results show that these models often fail to correctly classify obfuscated code, with precision, recall, and F1-score dropping significantly after transformation. This reveals a critical limitation: LLMs, despite their language understanding capabilities, can be easily misled by compiler-based obfuscation strategies. To promote reproducibility, we release all evaluation scripts, prompts, and obfuscated code samples in a public repository. We also discuss the implications of these findings for adversarial threat modeling, and outline future directions such as software watermarking, compiler-aware defenses, and obfuscation-resilient model design.</p></details> |  |

However, the key properties of language shaping brain-like representations, and their evolution during training as a function of different tasks remain unclear. We here benchmark 34 training checkpoints spanning 300B tokens across 8 different model sizes to analyze how brain alignment relates to linguistic competence. Specifically, we find that brain alignment tracks the development of formal linguistic competence -- i.e., knowledge of linguistic rules -- more closely than functional linguistic competence. While functional competence, which involves world knowledge and reasoning, continues to develop throughout training, its relationship with brain alignment is weaker, suggesting that the human language network primarily encodes formal linguistic structure rather than broader cognitive functions. We further show that model size is not a reliable predictor of brain alignment when controlling for feature size and find that the correlation between next-word prediction, behavioral alignment and brain alignment fades once models surpass human language proficiency. Finally, using the largest set of rigorous neural language benchmarks to date, we show that language brain alignment benchmarks remain unsaturated, highlighting opportunities for improving future models. Taken together, our findings suggest that the human language network is best modeled by formal, rather than functional, aspects of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025.

| **[Listening, Imagining & Refining: A Heuristic Optimized ASR Correction Framework with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15095v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain prone to errors that affect downstream applications. In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Inter-User Difference Modeling for LLM Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20849v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues, we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 EMNLP Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sugar-Coated Poison: Benign Generation Unlocks LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05652v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasingly deep integration of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, the effectiveness of their safety mechanisms is encountering severe challenges. Currently, jailbreak attacks based on prompt engineering have become a major safety threat. However, existing methods primarily rely on black-box manipulation of prompt templates, resulting in poor interpretability and limited generalization. To break through the bottleneck, this study first introduces the concept of Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), revealing the potential safety impact caused by LLMs' benign generation: as benign content generation in LLMs increases, the model's focus on input instructions progressively diminishes. Building on this insight, we propose the Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP) attack paradigm, which uses a "semantic reversal" strategy to craft benign inputs that are opposite in meaning to malicious intent. This strategy induces the models to generate extensive benign content, thereby enabling adversarial reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms. Experiments show that SCP outperforms existing baselines. Remarkably, it achieves an average attack success rate of 87.23% across six LLMs. For defense, we propose Part-of-Speech Defense (POSD), leveraging verb-noun dependencies for syntactic analysis to enhance safety of LLMs while preserving their generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Audio-Conditioned Diffusion LLMs for ASR and Deliberation Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16622v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have recently attracted growing interest as an alternative to autoregressive decoders. In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.</p></details> |  |
