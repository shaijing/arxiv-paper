We propose Bitune, a method that enhances pretrained decoder-only LLMs by incorporating bidirectional attention into prompt processing. We evaluate Bitune in instruction-tuning and question-answering settings, showing significant improvements in performance on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and language understanding tasks. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies validate the role of each component of the method, and demonstrate that Bitune is compatible with various parameter-efficient finetuning techniques and full model finetuning.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research Challenges in Relational Database Management Systems for LLM Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20912v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering. Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However, open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs, optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in the 6th International Workshop on Applied AI for Database Systems and Applications, AIDB Workshop at VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Publish to Perish: Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Assisted Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20863v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into the scientific peer-review process, raising new questions about their reliability and resilience to manipulation. In this work, we investigate the potential for hidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations -- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that adversely affect a "honest-but-lazy" reviewer. Finally, we propose and empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under automated content checks.</p></details> |  |
| **[cMALC-D: Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20818v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version has been accepted to the 2025 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Test-Harness for LLM Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20810v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

| **[Steering Towards Fairness: Mitigating Political Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08846v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we employ a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), this method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CASE@RANLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Formal Software Requirements -- Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14330v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software correctness is ensured mathematically through formal verification, which involves the resources of generating formal requirement specifications and having an implementation that must be verified. Tools such as model-checkers and theorem provers ensure software correctness by verifying the implementation against the specification. Formal methods deployment is regularly enforced in the development of safety-critical systems e.g. aerospace, medical devices and autonomous systems. Generating these specifications from informal and ambiguous natural language requirements remains the key challenge. Our project, VERIFAI^{1}, aims to investigate automated and semi-automated approaches to bridge this gap, using techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), ontology-based domain modelling, artefact reuse, and large language models (LLMs). This position paper presents a preliminary synthesis of relevant literature to identify recurring challenges and prospective research directions in the generation of verifiable specifications from informal requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Overl...</summary><p>Overlay2025 - 7th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and fOrmal VERification, Logic, Automata, and sYnthesis.

| **[Feel the Difference? A Comparative Analysis of Emotional Arcs in Real and LLM-Generated CBT Sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20764v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future research in this space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025,14 page,3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Specializing General-purpose LLM Embeddings for Implicit Hate Speech Detection across Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20750v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the DHOW Workshop at ACM Multimedia 2025.

| **[From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts. Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form. Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments. Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest. Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second. Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity. Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications. Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Testing for LLM Applications: Characteristics, Challenges, and a Lightweight Interaction Protocol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20737v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation, tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18321v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Buncher: Shielding LLMs from Harmful Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20697v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Hompage: https://tokenbuncher.github.io/</p></details> |

In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in red-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests. Defensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively less attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic study of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web application attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes packet-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the exploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences of core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture - and provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent architectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing complexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a separate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the exact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts, which rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They also expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source LLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our benchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible evaluation of forensic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SmartData-Polito/LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic</p></details> |
| **[Continuously Steering LLMs Sensitivity to Contextual Knowledge with Proxy Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19720v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/OliveJuiceLin/CSKS.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face core limitations from restrictive assumptions: traditional methods rely on predefined theoretical priors, while neural networks introduce hidden biases and lack interpretability. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), the first integration of large language model (LLM) guidance with domain-aware physical constraints for automated gravitational wave detection. This framework systematically explores algorithmic solution spaces through tree-structured search enhanced by evolutionary optimization, combining MCTS for strategic exploration with evolutionary algorithms for solution refinement. The LLM component provides domain-aware heuristics while maintaining interpretability through explicit algorithmic pathway generation. Experimental validation demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset and a remarkable 59.1% improvement over other LLM-based algorithm optimization frameworks. Beyond performance improvements, our framework establishes a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages (29 main), with 6+6 figures and 2 tables, presenting a more concise and updated manuscript</p></details> |

However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning. To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets, PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to 0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.</p></details> |  |
| **[RevPRAG: Revealing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through LLM Activation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p></details> |  |

Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

| **[Automated Quality Assessment for LLM-Based Complex Qualitative Coding: A Confidence-Diversity Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20462v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While previous research demonstrated effective automated quality assessment for accessible LLM coding tasks, a fundamental question remains: can confidence-diversity frameworks maintain reliability for complex analytical tasks requiring specialized domain expertise and extensive text comprehension? Traditional inter-coder reliability measures become prohibitively expensive at scale, yet the lack of reliable automated quality assessment methods creates methodological barriers to AI adoption in sophisticated qualitative research. This study extends dual-signal quality assessment combining model confidence and inter-model consensus from accessible to complex analytical domains. We systematically validate this approach across three domains: legal reasoning (390 Supreme Court cases), political analysis (645 hyperpartisan articles), and medical classification (1,000 clinical transcripts). Results demonstrate that uncertainty-based indicators maintain predictive validity in complex tasks, with external entropy showing consistent negative correlations with accuracy (r = -0.179 to -0.273, p < 0.001) and confidence exhibiting positive correlations in two domains (r = 0.104 to 0.429). Systematic weight optimization achieves 6.6 to 113.7 percent improvements over single-signal approaches, with optimized weights transferring effectively across domains (100 percent success rate). An intelligent triage system reduces manual verification effort by 44.6 percent while maintaining quality standards. These findings establish that automated quality assessment can scale from accessible to complex analytical tasks, providing practical tools for expanding AI-assisted qualitative research. Future work will focus on addressing long-tail challenges in high-disagreement, low-confidence cases to further enhance screening efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names, plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows - capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion. Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code and data: https://github.com/Accenture/mcp-bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ransomware 3.0: Self-Composing and LLM-Orchestrated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using automated reasoning, code synthesis, and contextual decision-making, we introduce a new threat that exploits large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle. Ransomware 3.0 represents the first threat model and research prototype of LLM-orchestrated ransomware. Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only requires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is synthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants that adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance, payload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack campaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal, enterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that measures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase. We show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and sustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments. Finally, we present behavioral signals and multi-level telemetry of Ransomware 3.0 through a case study to motivate future development of better defenses and policy enforcements to address novel AI-enabled ransomware attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20443v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of degraded utility. In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering a scalable and robust unlearning solution.</p></details> |  |

Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications , we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommendation Systems with Large Language Models (EARL) at RecSys 2025 (EARL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness. Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final decision. We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

EAS requires neither external models nor repeated sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets. In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets, improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in $\texttt{list.get(i)}$. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 findings |
| **[Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically, allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently. Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 pages Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safeguard Fine-Tuned LLMs Through Pre- and Post-Tuning Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19512v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, notably degrading the safety of originally aligned models. While some existing methods attempt to restore safety by incorporating additional safety data, the quality of such data typically falls short of that used in the original alignment process. Moreover, these high-quality safety datasets are generally inaccessible, making it difficult to fully recover the model's original safety. We ask: How can we preserve safety while improving downstream task performance without additional safety data? We show that simply merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models effectively mitigates safety degradation while enhancing performance. Experiments across different downstream tasks and models validate the method's practicality and effectiveness.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance. To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations. We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.</p></details> | 54 pages |

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

Investigating the Use of LLMs as Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18076v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Prepared for conference submission</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLM 2025</p></details> |

| **[Athena: Intermediate Representations for Iterative Scaffolded App Generation with an LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20263v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is challenging to generate the code for a complete user interface using a Large Language Model (LLM). User interfaces are complex and their implementations often consist of multiple, inter-related files that together specify the contents of each screen, the navigation flows between the screens, and the data model used throughout the application. It is challenging to craft a single prompt for an LLM that contains enough detail to generate a complete user interface, and even then the result is frequently a single large and difficult to understand file that contains all of the generated screens. In this paper, we introduce Athena, a prototype application generation environment that demonstrates how the use of shared intermediate representations, including an app storyboard, data model, and GUI skeletons, can help a developer work with an LLM in an iterative fashion to craft a complete user interface. These intermediate representations also scaffold the LLM's code generation process, producing organized and structured code in multiple files while limiting errors. We evaluated Athena with a user study that found 75% of participants preferred our prototype over a typical chatbot-style baseline for prototyping apps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks profoundly influence how humans form opinions, exchange information, and organize collectively. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwizzlePerf: Hardware-Aware LLMs for GPU Kernel Performance Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20258v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization -- hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving LLMs explicit hardware-awareness. For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels, SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM performance engineering agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20030v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for EDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference</p></details> |

Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of email titles for millions of users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Second Workshop on Generative AI for E-commerce (GenAIECommerce '25), held September 22, 2025, in Prague, Czech Republic. 3 figures</p></details> |

To understand when and how this emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for detecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both distributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are formulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective statistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that occurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular, we assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs is captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a decomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual behavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in the gradient norm alone. Our framework enables the automated discovery and quantification of language-based order parameters, which we demonstrate on examples ranging from knowledge questions to politics and ethics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11+25...</summary><p>11+25 pages, 4+11 figures</p></details> |

However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Organizing Agent Network for LLM-based Workflow Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13732v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths. Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore, developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.</p></details> |  |

Optimal Model Selection for Reliable Label Flipping Evaluation in LLM-based Counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13972v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and judge models: being the same model, belonging to the same model family, being independent models, and having an distillation relationship. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, three datasets, four generator models, and 15 judge models, complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INLG 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |

This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.</p></details> | 34 pages, 3 figures |

The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures, forming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and specialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the collaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack surfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based security cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces zero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the ``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing the security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we present the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey key technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI. Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification, context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based management, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust applied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical strategies.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></details> | v0.2 |

To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

We address the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to annotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per query, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal likelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO dataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG experiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of human labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations. Our study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for initializing QA systems on new corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the EMNLP25 main conference</p></details> |

Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating PL/SQL code into Java for the modernised "VTF3" system. By leveraging a dataset comprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively established a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were evaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that integrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting. Our findings indicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating syntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional correctness. However, the findings are limited by the small sample size of available code files and the restricted access to test cases used for validating the correctness of the generated code. Nevertheless, these findings lay the groundwork for scalable, automated solutions in modernising large legacy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based feature generation from text for interpretable machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07132v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability. This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynthCoder: A Synthetical Strategy to Tune LLMs for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15495v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Energy: Detecting LLM Hallucination Beyond Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14496v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes: Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education, particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

These prompts often contain business logic and sensitive information, making their protection essential. However, adversarial and even regular user queries can exploit LLM vulnerabilities to expose these hidden prompts. To address this issue, we propose PromptKeeper, a defense mechanism designed to safeguard system prompts by tackling two core challenges: reliably detecting leakage and mitigating side-channel vulnerabilities when leakage occurs. By framing detection as a hypothesis-testing problem, PromptKeeper effectively identifies both explicit and subtle leakage. Upon leakage detected, it regenerates responses using a dummy prompt, ensuring that outputs remain indistinguishable from typical interactions when no leakage is present. PromptKeeper ensures robust protection against prompt extraction attacks via either adversarial or regular queries, while preserving conversational capability and runtime efficiency during benign user interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Findings of EMNLP 2025. 17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The former, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's performance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end, multi-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This paradigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective allocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the agent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that decouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective optimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal based on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool invocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training signal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need for verifiable data. Our experiments demonstrate that RLTR achieves an 8%-12% improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. Moreover, this enhanced planning capability, in turn, translates to a 5%-6% increase in the final response quality of the overall agent system.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArgCMV: An Argument Summarization Benchmark for the LLM-era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19580v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key point extraction is an important task in argument summarization which involves extracting high-level short summaries from arguments. Existing approaches for KP extraction have been mostly evaluated on the popular ArgKP21 dataset. In this paper, we highlight some of the major limitations of the ArgKP21 dataset and demonstrate the need for new benchmarks that are more representative of actual human conversations. Using SoTA large language models (LLMs), we curate a new argument key point extraction dataset called ArgCMV comprising of around 12K arguments from actual online human debates spread across over 3K topics. Our dataset exhibits higher complexity such as longer, co-referencing arguments, higher presence of subjective discourse units, and a larger range of topics over ArgKP21. We show that existing methods do not adapt well to ArgCMV and provide extensive benchmark results by experimenting with existing baselines and latest open source models. This work introduces a novel KP extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage for the next generation of LLM-driven summarization research.</p></details> |  |

HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/HAMLET.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through extensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

| **[Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should: LLMs for Data Fitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19563v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</p></details> |  |

This architectural shift, while powerful, introduces significant operational challenges, including inefficient use of heterogeneous hardware, network bottlenecks, and critical imbalances between prefill and decode stages. We introduce HeteroScale, a coordinated autoscaling framework that addresses the core challenges of P/D disaggregated serving. HeteroScale combines a topology-aware scheduler that adapts to heterogeneous hardware and network constraints with a novel metric-driven policy derived from the first large-scale empirical study of autoscaling signals in production. By leveraging a single, robust metric to jointly scale prefill and decode pools, HeteroScale maintains architectural balance while ensuring efficient, adaptive resource management. Deployed in a massive production environment on tens of thousands of GPUs, HeteroScale has proven its effectiveness, increasing average GPU utilization by a significant 26.6 percentage points and saving hundreds of thousands of GPU-hours daily, all while upholding stringent service level objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Consistency of LLM Code Embeddings: A Self-Evolving Data Synthesis Framework for Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19558v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders. Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages total (10-page main paper + 17-page appendix), 12 figures, 6 tables.

However, their practical deployment is often limited by their low success rates under complex real-world environments. To tackle this, prior research has primarily focused on improving the agents themselves, such as developing strong agentic LLMs, while overlooking the role of the system environment in which the agent operates. In this paper, we study a complementary direction: improving agent success rates by optimizing the system environment in which the agent operates. We collect 142 agent traces (3,656 turns of agent-environment interactions) across 5 state-of-the-art agentic benchmarks. By analyzing these agent failures, we propose a taxonomy for agent-environment interaction failures that includes 6 failure modes. Guided by these findings, we design Aegis, a set of targeted environment optimizations: 1) environment observability enhancement, 2) common computation offloading, and 3) speculative agentic actions. These techniques improve agent success rates on average by 6.7-12.5%, without any modifications to the agent and underlying LLM.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication at the IEEE Transactions on Games 2024, Special Issue on Large Language Models and Games (10 pages excluding appendix, 3 figures)</p></details> |

To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19461v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19432v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025 main conference (poster)</p></details> |

Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Yet, realizing these benefits remains challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper, we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit at https://github.com/StuRinDQB/FineEdit} and https://huggingface.co/datasets/YimingZeng/FineEdit_bench.</p></details> |  |

While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2) Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline for scientific reasoning.</p></details> | 28 pages, 16 figures |

Firstly, we introduce the wildly used instruction datasets.

Beyond merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures. The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective partners in clinical practice and medical research.</p></details> |  |

Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts, as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models (LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20 under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs. Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[APT-LLM: Exploiting Arbitrary-Precision Tensor Core Computing for LLM Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19087v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however, attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM. Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication (MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD)</p></details> |
| **[HiPlan: Hierarchical Planning for LLM-Based Agents with Adaptive Global-Local Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19076v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex, long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of its hierarchical components.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartBench: Is Your LLM Truly a Good Chinese Smartphone Assistant?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06029v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, especially advancing as intelligent assistants through on-device deployment on smartphones. However, existing LLM evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective tasks like mathematics and coding in English, which do not necessarily reflect the practical use cases of on-device LLMs in real-world mobile scenarios, especially for Chinese users. To address these gaps, we introduce SmartBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of on-device LLMs in Chinese mobile contexts. We analyze functionalities provided by representative smartphone manufacturers and divide them into five categories: text summarization, text Q&A, information extraction, content creation, and notification management, further detailed into 20 specific tasks. For each task, we construct high-quality datasets comprising 50 to 200 question-answer pairs that reflect everyday mobile interactions, and we develop automated evaluation criteria tailored for these tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of on-device LLMs and MLLMs using SmartBench and also assess their performance after quantized deployment on real smartphone NPUs. Our contributions provide a standardized framework for evaluating on-device LLMs in Chinese, promoting further development and optimization in this critical area. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/vivo-ai-lab/SmartBench.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[An LLM-powered Natural-to-Robotic Language Translation Framework with Correctness Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19074v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Structured Templates Facilitate LLMs in Tackling Harder Tasks? : An Exploration of Scaling Laws by Difficulty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19069v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction, while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[SKA-Bench: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Knowledge Understanding of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17178v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon.
