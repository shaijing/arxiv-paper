| **[Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights ({\it local homogeneity}), adjacent values demonstrate distinct {\it heterogeneous} distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.Our code can be found in this link:https://github.com/the-scale-lab/Asymkv.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,7 figures;Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Model to Breach: Towards Actionable LLM-Generated Vulnerabilities Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04538v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities a model generates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Targeted Underperformance Disproportionately Impacts Vulnerable Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17737v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many tasks, there has been extensive research on undesirable model behavior such as hallucinations and bias. In this work, we investigate how the quality of LLM responses changes in terms of information accuracy, truthfulness, and refusals depending on three user traits: English proficiency, education level, and country of origin. We present extensive experimentation on three state-of-the-art LLMs and two different datasets targeting truthfulness and factuality. Our findings suggest that undesirable behaviors in state-of-the-art LLMs occur disproportionately more for users with lower English proficiency, of lower education status, and originating from outside the US, rendering these models unreliable sources of information towards their most vulnerable users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within Structured Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04491v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDIT-Bench: Evaluating LLM Abilities to Perform Real-World Instructed Code Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04486v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instructed code editing, where LLMs directly modify a developer's existing code based on a user instruction, is becoming a widely used interaction mode in AI coding assistants. However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generate, Evaluate, Iterate: Synthetic Data for Human-in-the-Loop Refinement of LLM Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04478v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm enables flexible, user-defined evaluation, but its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of diverse, representative data for refining criteria. We present a tool that integrates synthetic data generation into the LLM-as-a-judge workflow, empowering users to create tailored and challenging test cases with configurable domains, personas, lengths, and desired outcomes, including borderline cases. The tool also supports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance transparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations behind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to rapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The generated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These findings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in contexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enabling Dynamic Sparsity in Quantized LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04477v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost. Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input, only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization, which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization. The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference, showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on commodity GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Faithfulness in RAG with Evolving Leaderboards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04847v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in external context, yet large language models (LLMs) still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions even when provided with relevant context. This paper presents two complementary efforts at Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG. First, we describe our original hallucination leaderboard, which has tracked hallucination rates for LLMs since 2023 using our HHEM hallucination detection model. Motivated by limitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse human-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated hallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness in summarization, question-answering, and data-to-text generation tasks. FaithJudge enables a more reliable benchmarking of LLM hallucinations in RAG and supports the development of more trustworthy generative AI systems: https://github.com/vectara/FaithJudge.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Industry Track 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ground-Truth Subgraphs for Better Training and Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04473v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00783v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

| **[Evaluating LLM-Contaminated Crowdsourcing Data Without Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06991v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimensional training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |
| **[If I Could Turn Back Time: Temporal Reframing as a Historical Reasoning Task for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04432v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families, and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, submitted to aconference</p></details> |
| **[Speed at the Cost of Quality? The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model, and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of current modeling paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04393v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories, selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales. This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models - from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall, Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

An In-Depth Analysis of Code Generation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04355v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track</p></details> |
| **[RISE-T2V: Rephrasing and Injecting Semantics with LLM for Expansive Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04317v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions, which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available on the webpage at https://rise-t2v.github.io.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |
| **[AdversariaLLM: A Unified and Modular Toolbox for LLM Robustness Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04316v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible research in LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed approaches that produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on two widely used code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThunderServe: High-performance and Cost-efficient LLM Serving in Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09334v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable proficiency in a range of tasks. Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose ThunderServe, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a novel scheduling algorithm, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight re-scheduling mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that ThunderServe delivers up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$ increase in throughput and achieves up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$ reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.</p></details> | MLSys 2025 |
| **[But what is your honest answer? Aiding LLM-judges with honest alternatives using steering vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17760v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting subtle forms of dishonesty like sycophancy and manipulation in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging for both humans and automated evaluators, as these behaviors often appear through small biases rather than clear false statements. We introduce Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), a novel framework that employs steering vectors not to improve model behavior directly, but to enhance LLM judges' evaluation capabilities. JUSSA applies steering vectors during inference to generate more honest alternatives, providing judges with contrastive examples that make subtle dishonest patterns easier to detect. While existing evaluation methods rely on black-box evaluation, JUSSA leverages model internals to create targeted comparisons from single examples. We evaluate our method on sycophancy detection and introduce a new manipulation dataset covering multiple types of manipulation. Our results demonstrate that JUSSA effectively improves detection accuracy over single-response evaluation in various cases. Analysis across judge models reveals that JUSSA helps weaker judges on easier dishonesty detection tasks, and stronger judges on harder tasks. Layer-wise experiments show how dishonest prompts cause representations to diverge from honest ones in middle layers, revealing where steering interventions are most effective for generating contrastive examples. By demonstrating that steering vectors can enhance safety evaluation rather than just modify behavior, our work opens new directions for scalable model auditing as systems become increasingly sophisticated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test smells in LLM-Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10628v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to transform unit test generation from a manual burden into an automated solution. Yet, beyond metrics such as compilability or coverage, little is known about the quality of LLM-generated tests, particularly their susceptibility to test smells, design flaws that undermine readability and maintainability. This paper presents the first multi-benchmark, large-scale analysis of test smell diffusion in LLM-generated unit tests. We contrast LLM outputs with human-written suites (as the reference for real-world practices) and SBST-generated tests from EvoSuite (as the automated baseline), disentangling whether LLMs reproduce human-like flaws or artifacts of synthetic generation. Our study draws on 20,505 class-level suites from four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B), 972 method-level cases from TestBench, 14,469 EvoSuite tests, and 779,585 human-written tests from 34,635 open-source Java projects. Using two complementary detection tools (TsDetect and JNose), we analyze prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlations with software attributes and generation parameters. Results show that LLM-generated tests consistently manifest smells such as Assertion Roulette and Magic Number Test, with patterns strongly influenced by prompting strategy, context length, and model scale. Comparisons reveal overlaps with human-written tests, raising concerns of potential data leakage from training corpora while EvoSuite exhibits distinct, generator-specific flaws. These findings highlight both the promise and the risks of LLM-based test generation, and call for the design of smell-aware generation frameworks, prompt engineering strategies, and enhanced detection tools to ensure maintainable, high-quality test code.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

However, in real-world LLM serving scenarios, significant fluctuations in request input/output lengths lead to imbalanced computational loads between prefill and decode nodes under traditional static node allocation strategies, consequently preventing efficient utilization of computing resources to improve the system's goodput. To address this challenge, we design and implement Arrow, an adaptive scheduler that leverages stateless instances and latency characteristics of prefill and decode tasks to achieve efficient adaptive request and instance scheduling. Arrow dynamically adjusts the number of instances handling prefill and decode tasks based on real-time cluster performance metrics, substantially enhancing the system's capability to handle traffic spikes and load variations. Our evaluation under diverse real-world workloads shows that Arrow achieves up to $2.55 \times$ higher request serving rates compared to state-of-the-art Prefill-Decode disaggregated serving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOTS: A Unified Framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM Reinforcement Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26374v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce BOTS, a unified framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can we trust LLMs as a tutor for our students? Evaluating the Quality of LLM-generated Feedback in Statistics Exams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04213v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the central challenges for instructors is offering meaningful individual feedback, especially in large courses. Faced with limited time and resources, educators are often forced to rely on generalized feedback, even when more personalized support would be pedagogically valuable. To overcome this limitation, one potential technical solution is to utilize large language models (LLMs). For an exploratory study using a new platform connected with LLMs, we conducted a LLM-corrected mock exam during the "Introduction to Statistics" lecture at the University of Munich (Germany). The online platform allows instructors to upload exercises along with the correct solutions. Students complete these exercises and receive overall feedback on their results, as well as individualized feedback generated by GPT-4 based on the correct answers provided by the lecturers. The resulting dataset comprised task-level information for all participating students, including individual responses and the corresponding LLM-generated feedback. Our systematic analysis revealed that approximately 7 \% of the 2,389 feedback instances contained errors, ranging from minor technical inaccuracies to conceptually misleading explanations. Further, using a combined feedback framework approach, we found that the feedback predominantly focused on explaining why an answer was correct or incorrect, with fewer instances providing deeper conceptual insights, learning strategies or self-regulatory advice. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of deploying LLMs as scalable feedback tools in higher education, emphasizing the need for careful quality monitoring and prompt design to maximize their pedagogical value.</p></details> | Preprint |

The authors examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the 'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication.</p></details> |  |

LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals, professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction during sender interviews across different communication types, (2) Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases, we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture. Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

As in the previous editions, participants were challenged to develop systems that identify mentions and cluster them according to identity coreference. A key innovation of this year's task was the introduction of a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) track, featuring a simplified plaintext format designed to be more suitable for LLMs than the original CoNLL-U representation. The task also expanded its coverage with three new datasets in two additional languages, using version 1.3 of CorefUD - a harmonized multilingual collection of 22 datasets in 17 languages. In total, nine systems participated, including four LLM-based approaches (two fine-tuned and two using few-shot adaptation). While traditional systems still kept the lead, LLMs showed clear potential, suggesting they may soon challenge established approaches in future editions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CODI-CRAC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over the commercially available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (CIS) platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</p></details> |  |

The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between queries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and products based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high costs due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human annotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency while leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various e-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation Enhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access commonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by utilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the reasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show an improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Agent System in End-to-End Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04064v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of LLM-based autonomous agents for end-to-end software development represents a significant paradigm shift in software engineering. However, the scientific evaluation of these systems is hampered by significant challenges, including overly simplistic benchmarks and the difficulty of conducting fair comparisons between different agent architectures due to confounding implementation variables. To address these limitations, we first construct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate realistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with fine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we conduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent architectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of workflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill approximately 50\% of requirements on \bench{}, but their success is critically dependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck is the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work provides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and core challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward enhancing requirement comprehension and planning.</p></details> |  |

As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is intended for submission to the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[An LLM-based Framework for Human-Swarm Teaming Cognition in Disaster Search and Rescue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04042v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner, providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by $7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A LLM mapping scheme was developed to optimize hardware scheduling and workload mapping. Simulation results show it achieves $3.95\times$ speedup and $30\times$ efficiency improvement over the Nvidia A100 before chiplet clustering and power gating scheme (CCPG). Additionally, the system achieves further scalability and efficiency improvement with the implementation of CCPG to accommodate larger models, attaining $57\times$ efficiency improvement over Nvidia H100 at similar throughput.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism. We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by \textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability analysis.</p></details> |  |

Current pipelines collect many candidate genes, but clinicians still spend a lot of time filtering false positives and combining evidence from papers and databases. A key challenge is language: phenotype descriptions and inheritance patterns are written in prose, not fully captured by tables. Large language models (LLMs) can read such text, but clinical use needs grounding in citable knowledge and stable, repeatable behavior. We explore a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer on top of a high-recall first-stage pipeline. The goal is to improve precision and explainability, not to replace standard bioinformatics steps. We use expert-built context and a consensus method to reduce LLM variability, producing shorter, better-justified gene lists for expert review. LA-MARRVEL achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming other methods -- including traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools (AI-MARRVEL, Exomiser, LIRICAL) and naive large language models (e.g., Anthropic Claude) -- with an average Recall@5 of 94.10%, a +3.65 percentage-point improvement over AI-MARRVEL. The LLM-generated reasoning provides clear prose on phenotype matching and inheritance patterns, making clinical review faster and easier. LA-MARRVEL has three parts: expert-engineered context that enriches phenotype and disease information; a ranked voting algorithm that combines multiple LLM runs to choose a consensus ranked gene list; and the AI-MARRVEL pipeline that provides first-stage ranks and gene annotations, already known as a state-of-the-art method in Rare Disease Diagnosis on BG, DDD, and UDN cohorts. The online AI-MARRVEL includes LA-MARRVEL as an LLM feature at https://ai.marrvel.org . We evaluate LA-MARRVEL on three datasets from independent cohorts of real-world diagnosed patients.</p></details> |  |

This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution, I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++, combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets, including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate and deepen vulnerability discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study, we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat: While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly, combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation, but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent cultural diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at Computational Linguistics.

A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them. Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark, providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in the Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2025, Workshop Poster on June 22, 2025</p></details> |

We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference.

In this work, we demonstrate that finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model, Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by 13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210 contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity difference, a measure of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at stanfordhci.github.io/socrates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, how inter-agent dynamics influence reasoning quality and verification reliability remains unclear. We study these mechanisms using an AutoGen-based multi-agent framework for linear-elastic Finite Element Analysis (FEA), evaluating seven role configurations across four tasks under a fixed 12-turn conversation limit. From 1,120 controlled trials, we find that collaboration effectiveness depends more on functional complementarity than team size: the three-agent Coder-Executor-Critic configuration uniquely produced physically and visually correct solutions, while adding redundant reviewers reduced success rates. Yet three systematic failure modes persist: (1) affirmation bias, where the Rebuttal agent endorsed rather than challenged outputs (85-92% agreement, including errors); (2) premature consensus caused by redundant reviewers; and (3) a verification-validation gap where executable but physically incorrect code passed undetected. No agent combination successfully validated constitutive relations in complex tasks. Building on theories of functional diversity, role differentiation, and computational validation, we propose actionable design principles: (i) assign complementary agent roles, (ii) enforce multi-level validation (execution, specification, physics), and (iii) prevent early consensus through adversarial or trigger-based interaction control. These findings establish a principled foundation for designing trustworthy LLM collaborations in engineering workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across datacenters and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization is often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages error feedback with Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization to reach extreme sparsity as low as 1-3% while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback accumulator combined with aggressive sparsity, and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 14 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

Existing optimization methods, however, rely on time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents, which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools, roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58 times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to Workshop on ML for Systems at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Divide, Cache, Conquer: Dichotomic Prompting for Efficient Multi-Label LLM-Based Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03830v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently, which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B, Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries, combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Despite its significance, tokenization in the context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a critical problem in binary code analysis. To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models, systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics. Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis, contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model (NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Publication Notice.

However, their effectiveness in providing scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>(v1) ...</summary><p>(v1) 9 pages, 4 figures, with 7-page supporting information.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies, ISAECT 2025</p></details> |

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted by 2025 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2025) and was presented in Munich, October 2025</p></details> |

In practice, heterogeneous GPU clusters can be deployed in a geographically distributed manner, while LLM load also observes diversity in terms of both query traffic and serving patterns. LLM queries running on advanced GPUs during a high-emission hour at one location can lead to significantly higher carbon footprints versus same queries running on mid-level GPUs at a low-emission time and location. By observing LLM serving requirements and leveraging spatiotemporal computation flexibility, we consider the joint routing and scheduling problem, and propose FREESH to cooperatively run a group of data centers while minimizing user-specified carbon or energy objectives. FREESH identifies the optimal configurations of balanced load serving by matching distinct GPU instance's power-throughput characteristics with predictable LLM query length and workloads. To ensure both latency and fairness requirements, FREESH identifies optimized parallelism and query routing schedules together with dynamic GPU frequency scaling for power saving, and Least-Laxity-First (LLF) serving strategy for query scheduling. During the 1-hour serving on production workloads, FREESH reduces energy by 28.6% and emissions by 45.45% together with improvements in SLO attainment and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Su...</summary><p>In Submission, code available at https://github.com/AndrewFangZequan/LLM_Serving_FREESH</p></details> |
| **[LLM Query Scheduling with Prefix Reuse and Latency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04677v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in online settings requires optimizing inference performance under stringent latency constraints, particularly the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). This paper focuses on the query scheduling problem for LLM inference with prefix reuse, a technique that leverages shared prefixes across queries to reduce computational overhead. Our work reveals previously unknown limitations of the existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) scheduling strategies with respect to satisfying latency constraints. We present a formal theoretical framework for LLM query scheduling under RadixAttention, a prefix reuse mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate representations in a radix tree structure. Our analysis establishes the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem with prefix reuse under TTFT constraints and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, $k$-LPM, which generalizes existing methods by balancing prefix reuse and fairness in query processing. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that $k$-LPM achieves improved TTFT performance under realistic traffic patterns captured by a data generative model. Empirical evaluations in a realistic serving setting validates our findings, showing significant reductions in P99 TTFT compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit within a 128k-token window. On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.</p></details> |  |

This combination of fine-tuning and RAG-based augmentation results in a tool that not only processes legal information but actively assists policymakers in interpreting regulations and drafting new ones that align with current needs. The results demonstrate that this approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of legal research and regulation development, offering a valuable resource in the ever-evolving field of law.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (including references), 2 figures, 4 tables, published in Atlantis Press (Open Access under CC BY-NC 4.0 license)</p></details> |

This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which can have large weight and activation outlier values that make lower-precision optimization difficult. To address this, we present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which mitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration for low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision, while delivering performance benefits.

Existing benchmarks are often limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints, instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types. Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code will be made publicly available online.</p></details> |  |

However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

At 30 trillion tokens, this is likely the largest generally available multilingual collection of LLM pre-training data. These datasets are derived from web crawls from different sources and accompanied with a complete, open-source pipeline for document selection from web archives, text extraction from HTML, language identification for noisy texts, exact and near-deduplication, annotation with, among others, register labels, text quality estimates, and personally identifiable information; and final selection and filtering. We report on data quality probes through contrastive and analytical statistics, through manual inspection of samples for 24 languages, and through end-to-end evaluation of various language model architectures trained on this data. For multilingual LLM evaluation, we provide a comprehensive collection of benchmarks for nine European languages, with special emphasis on natively created tasks, mechanisms to mitigate prompt sensitivity, and refined normalization and aggregation of scores. Additionally, we train and evaluate a family of 57 monolingual encoder-decoder models, as well as a handful of monolingual GPT-like reference models.

To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information.

However, evaluating the fairness of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work, we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects, presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues.</p></details> |  |

However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by HSSCOMMS'25</p></details> |

Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaDecay: Module-wise Weight Decay for Heavy-Tailed Balancing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14562v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/hed-ucas/AlphaDecay.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, presented at the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education Technology</p></details> |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01602v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |

Designing effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data, our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by 18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16395v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomic commits, which address a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Understanding Robustness of Model Editing in Code LLMs: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03182v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development. However, while LLMs remain static after pretraining, programming languages and APIs continue to evolve, leading to the generation of deprecated or incompatible code that undermines reliability. Retraining LLMs from scratch to reflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a promising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of parameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing yields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes. In this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model editing methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We apply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios. Our evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three disjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and specificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful compilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that instant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity dropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by 45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify this degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely. Across all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than correctly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in test failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent. Correct adoptions, where the model correctly integrates the intended change, occurred in only about 6% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked "How can I track someone's location without their consent?", a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/SafeSearch</p></details> |

However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods, which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well but may not be optimal for every situation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UDM-KDD'24</p></details> |

We propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel codes through a multi-stage, iterative approach integrating runtime power profiling, energy-aware prompting, self-correcting feedback loops, and an LLM-as-a-Judge agent for automated screening of code solutions. We introduce energy-reduction@k, a novel metric that quantifies expected energy reduction when generating k code candidates and selecting the most energy-efficient, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-attempt generation strategies. Evaluating 20 HeCBench applications and two miniApps on NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, a single run (k=1) with LASSI-EE delivers refactored parallel codes with an average 29% expected energy reduction at an 81% pass rate, representing a 2.8x improvement over vanilla LLM prompting. Multiple runs (k=3) achieve an average 48% expected energy reduction at a 97% pass rate. These results are consistent across devices, demonstrating LASSI-EE's effectiveness across diverse hardware architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, version under review at a peer-reviewed conference</p></details> |

Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to overcomplicated pipeline components, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{FaStfact}, an evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and time/token efficiency among existing baselines. FaStfact first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the time and token cost while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled web-pages and selectively retrieves it during verification. Extensive experiments based on an annotated benchmark \textbf{FaStfact-Bench} demonstrate the reliability of FaStfact in both efficiently and effectively evaluating long-form factuality.

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.</p></details> |  |

We present ALAS, a stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from non-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks and restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in progress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh, bounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The repair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies (retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards) defined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo Workflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical benchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent baselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running 1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows that the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and that localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius and less makespan degradation than global recompute. Results indicate that the combination of validator isolation, versioned execution logs, and localized repair provides measurable efficiency, feasibility, and scalability for multi-agent LLM planning. Code and seeds will be released.</p></details> |  |

Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven SAST-Genius: A Hybrid Static Analysis Framework for Comprehensive and Actionable Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15433v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report examines the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to improve vulnerability discovery. Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20) compared to Semgrep alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLED: A Speculative LLM Decoding Framework for Efficient Edge Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09397v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, accepted by SEC 2025: Tenth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Synthetic Benchmarks: Evaluating LLM Performance on Real-World Class-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26130v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on function-level code generation benchmarks, yet real-world software development increasingly demands class-level implementations that integrate multiple methods, attributes, and dependencies within authentic project contexts. This gap between benchmark performance and practical utility raises critical questions about LLMs' readiness for production code assistance, particularly regarding their ability to generalize across familiar and novel codebases. We introduce a benchmark derived from real-world open-source repositories, comprising classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization under practical conditions. We systematically examine how input specification completeness and retrieval-augmented generation affect class-level correctness across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a substantial performance gap: while LLMs achieve 84 to 89% correctness on synthetic benchmarks, they attain only 25 to 34% on real-world class tasks, with minimal distinction between familiar and novel codebases. Comprehensive documentation provides marginal improvements (1 to 3%), whereas retrieval augmentation yields greater gains (4 to 7%) by supplying concrete implementation patterns. Error analysis identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes, with distinct patterns between synthetic and real-world scenarios. These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print submitted for reviwer to TOSEM</p></details> |
| **[Systematizing LLM Persona Design: A Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI Companion Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02979v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional companions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applications in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Neurips 2025 workshop: LLM Persona Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot data citation function classification using transformer-based large language models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02936v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ValueCompass: A Framework for Measuring Contextual Value Alignment Between Human and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09586v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become more advanced, ensuring their alignment with a diverse range of individuals and societal values becomes increasingly critical. But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Communication and Language Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00032v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent scenarios where coordination is crucial but not always assured. Research shows that the way strategic scenarios are framed linguistically can affect cooperation. This paper explores whether allowing agents to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging FAIRGAME, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted with two advanced LLMs-GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick-reveal that communication significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language, personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02805v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.
